<Text_Begin> @NielsieL Yep he was bending over after that break. Back hurting him again? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NielsieL Man both guys are hurting. Warriors. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NielsieL Wait did Djoko just throw up..? Or was he just spitting out water? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NielsieL Yeahhhhhh!!!! One more set!! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NielsieL But you KNOW it's only a matter of time until Djoko finds another gear and steps it up. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NielsieL I know Djoko's been having wrist problems. #VamosRafa!!! Get that 14th GS 😍😍❤️🎾 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> My weekend: OITNB binge watch. #excited <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NielsieL I hope so! Would love to see him win (unless it's against Rafa)! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NielsieL **but only if someone else beats Djoko lol. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NielsieL Wimby, no. USO, yes. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NielsieL He was SO CLOSE this year. Stupid back problems. I just need Stan to beat Djoko again in next year's Aussie as well haha 😝 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NielsieL I wouldn't be surprised if Roger makes a really good run at Wimby. I'm still waiting on a 2x career slam from Rafa 😉 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NielsieL What is it now, 13 v 17? I still think Roger has 1 more left in him, but as long as Rafa stays healthy he'll take over. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NielsieL I am EXTREMELY nervous about Sunday's final. Hate to say it, but I think it's gonna be Djoko's year. <Text_End>
