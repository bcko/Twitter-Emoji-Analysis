<Text_Begin> that place amara took dean too reminded me of a broken down version of that dock cas visited dean at in his dream <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> At this point can cas go live with Jody and Claire? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> the only thing god ever told us to do sam is hoard toilet paper so just get your roll of charmin and sit down <Text_End>

amara gets your paws off dean
cas - idek man come over to my house i will bake you cookies <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> (i mean tho if i was emily swallow i would want to keep kissing jensen) but amara/dean is wrong on every level <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @aIohacowboy i mean he's satan so...but its that these things are always played off as jokes instead of seen for what they are <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> amara was what made dean leave baby rusted and broken, what made him take up with crowley, what made him slaughter and ache and bleed <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @SuperWhoDawn brl are gross bc esp with amara i didnt see it being presented as that bad <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @meghaner: https://t.co/VOKWqTQgMr <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> "i dont want to be that thing again"

that thing was amara

that thing that ate dean up for a season and a half? that's amara! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> she is the anti-free will, she is everything Dean doesn't believe in - she is what corrupted him what turned him against sam and cas <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> did you hear what she said to dean? basically that he cant resist? he cant say no? he has no choice? what does that sound like to you? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> amen the only finger that's seeing a ring is castiel's https://t.co/qswKHAKCev <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ok u know what im gonna go off for a minute because what amara is doing to dean is disgusting <Text_End>

me: robbie did his job so good your just a turnip butt <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> don't worry about sam cas is gonna take his place in the cage/as lucifer's vessel <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> it's weird how s11 consisted of only episode i think it was called baby <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @tehjessicarae the show is so inconsistent now and silly <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> idek how to feel about the amara/cas parallels in the sense of like amara as the dark to cas's light in a way the anti-cas <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> am i bad person for laughing through that whole episode? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> yes but i liked that ep anyway tho cas shoulda been there https://t.co/d4zTfZXiZd <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Some of my favorite destiel is in S9 clearly I'm not to be trusted <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @tehjessicarae @TimeLady_Impala @IEatBrains4Fun @CottonCandyCas let cas be cas <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @patwoodsx @CottonCandyCas i hope he meant emotionally - i mean misha has no way of knowing "forever" on the show unless he dies even then <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> everyone has their own "when destiel was great" time they get nostalgic but everyone's is different <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @patwoodsx @CottonCandyCas maybe misha will only have to be luci for an ep :/ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> what i really want is jensen playing cas and misha playing dean for an episode <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> im only on board with cas being lucifers vessel if cas can actually grace out or w/e into dean <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> lol this sucks but i bet its what happens  https://t.co/olHQ38PvrU <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @misheeIs i have so many feels i miss that vibe - i do think thats one thing thats lacked in later seasons maybe too bc theyre older <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @CottonCandyCas i wish <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> have i mentioned yet im obsessed with kripke's pitch bc i am - that's how you sell a thing <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @SuchFun_AreWe @ChaoticBeauty26 @HikariTennyo yeah but probably bc they agree or have a strong central voice spn lacks this sadly <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> im sorry but dean winchester is one of the richest, most complex, most beautiful characters ever written <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @RestingPlatypus: America!  https://t.co/xwZuORGf2w <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @pietoperdition it made him see it was possible and made dean feel weak <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> if wayward daughters existed it would be cool if misha was on both shows like 13 eps on each <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @pietoperdition dean acted like he was mad at sam for leaving but he admired him so much <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @HikariTennyo @SuchFun_AreWe @ChaoticBeauty26 yes, and that's concerning on a different level <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> there is no excuse for how they often treat the women when they do come on the show <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> unpopular opinion: im kinda ok with supernatural being a show about the relationships between me -- that said <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @HikariTennyo @SuchFun_AreWe @ChaoticBeauty26 dean says he doesnt swing that way but hiding your sexuality is common <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ChaoticBeauty26 @HikariTennyo @SuchFun_AreWe thats a big part of it - it's written by more than one person it cant be always consistent <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @pietoperdition it kills me - like you just feel deans pain and hard it is for him to keep up that charade <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ChaoticBeauty26 oh bc people are homophobic :/ but honestly yeah thats it thats the only reason it challenges their world view <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @pietoperdition it is beautiful and hidden in the jokey single man tear thing but underneath just so real <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @meghaner just remember singer can stop the destiel but he has no control over the cockles train <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @meghaner this is every day's aesthetic though <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @ChaoticBeauty26 omg it's important for so many reasons though but it doesnt /have/ to be <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @meghaner me too - im almost managing <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> We get to claim Cas too but this seems to be less questioned <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Sorry lol I actually listened to dean's part in single man tear and it gave me bi!dean feels hard <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Of course it would be better and right for the show to acknowledge Dean's reality fully but even with they wont we still get to claim Dean <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I dont think it's fair to tell lgbt fans Dean is not "real" rep when they are saying yes this man is like me, he is one of us,&amp; he is a hero <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It's so easy to see ourselves in Dean and his struggles, especially with identity and family - and found family. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Like for GA and heteronormative folks theyre not gonna look at Dean and see it but many queer people of all genders relate to Dean <Text_End>
