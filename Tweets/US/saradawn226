<Text_Begin> @StalidzaneElza @dreamingahead It's used in translating "chick magnet." ... skuķu magnēts. I consider "chick" informal, but not offensive. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @marbear1981 I did. :-) It can be a long, humbling process (took me more than one try, takes many more than one try), but totally worth it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @dreamingahead Is "skuķis" offensive? They use it on Episodes for "chick," which is a fine word to me, but in dictionary seems less so. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @dreamingahead I thought she did a great job in the Temple Grandin movie, even though I didn't want to admit it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KasparZ Ha! I thought you were preparing me for another night out on the town... ;-) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @dreamingahead Yes, maybe it still has to premiere. I cannot stand Claire Danes, but I've heard it's a really good show. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @dreamingahead Just seems weird that it's the same if it's me + someone versus me + someone + someone. :-) Oh, LATVIAN! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KasparZ Ahhhh, ok. Whew! Hopefully not a phrase I'll need often, but good to have if necessary. :-) <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @KasparZ Many?!? Oh goodness...did I just tweet something really awful? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @dreamingahead So you'd say the same if it were you + one person, versus you and a friend + another person you picked up along the way? <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @eriksmiks Ok, I understand what you're saying about harder vs softer. Do you agree that atraidīt is for rejecting people? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @StalidzaneElza The human beings vs. things/requests makes sense to me. But can you also atraidīt an idea? <Text_End>
