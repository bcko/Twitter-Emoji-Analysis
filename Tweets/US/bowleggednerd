<Text_Begin> *steps off soapbox* <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It makes me sick. Why do people care so much about who people do or don't fuck male or female? If people love each other, BE HAPPY FOR THEM. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> This is why M/M ships don't become canon; because M/M relationships aren't very well received in reality. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Yes, men are minutely sexualized compared to women; therefore, seeing two men do anything even remotely sexual together is "disgusting." <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> But when it comes to male homosexuality, there is a huge backlash. Why? Because society expects men to be dominant over women. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It's absolutely disgusting how ass-backwards society is. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Society is tolerant of female homosexuality bc society also views women as sexual objects, and sexual objects being sexual together is okay. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The really fucked up thing is that I can bet you a million dollars that if Dean and Cas were women, destiel would've been canon years ago. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> But the notoriously shitty, anti-destiel writing of Dean forced him to act out of character in this particular instance. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> No, I don't think so. Regardless of what you ship, you can't deny that Cas is family; therefore, Dean wouldn't have gotten distracted. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Let's change the scenario. Let's say Sam was under that spell and Dean was looking for him. Do you think he'd stop and ogle a woman then? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> -woman at that point. Dean is a professional who wouldn't allow himself to become distracted by ANYTHING during a life or death situation. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> -of character of him. Dean was on quest to find Cas before he killed someone or died himself. He wouldn't have even cared about ogling a- <Text_End>
