<Text_Begin> @ChuckJames919 @AbeVigoda10 so why did you say my tuition funded Bramlage? It clearly did not. And athletics got almost no money from me. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AbeVigoda10 @ChuckJames919 yeah it's ignorant to not know how institutions are funded. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ChuckJames919 @AbeVigoda10 I'm agreeing with Pres Shultz in that none of this should've happens. Coaches, players, the chant. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @AbeVigoda10 @ChuckJames919 so I'm supposed to take crap about a basketball ranking from a KSU fan?? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AbeVigoda10 @CiaraChambers wow that's clever. Since US News ranks my program #1. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AbeVigoda10 @ChuckJames919 so it's a bad thing to serve an institution that you're a part of now? Well crap. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @AbeVigoda10 @ChuckJames919 since I was in SGA I'd know that fees were minimal when I was there. Like 10% of the total priv fee to athletics <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ChuckJames919 @AbeVigoda10 Hahahahaha yeah winning is so boring. Like all the time. 58 conference titles is no fun! /s <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AbeVigoda10 @ChuckJames919 plus tuition doesn't fund athletics. If you had a decent education you'd know that. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AbeVigoda10 @ChuckJames919 The fact that it was necessary ought to make you ashamed of the fans. Checking an opposing player? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AbeVigoda10 @kstatesports go for it. I'll enjoy winning 10 conference titles in a row. And winning 90% of the "rivialry" games in my life <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ChuckJames919 @AbeVigoda10 it was years ago. And I was feeling charitable. It's more fun when the "rivalry" is competitive. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AbeVigoda10 no more argument? Dang. I was having fun. And btw, getting a master's at KU in the #1 public admin program in America. <Text_End>
