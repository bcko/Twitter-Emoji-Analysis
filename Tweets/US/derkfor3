<Text_Begin> Ready for some league basketball at @DerbyRec this weekend. Should be interesting. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Orangemud Ha, will do. Just moved here in January (my hometown is much smaller). But I'm the newspaper editor, so I meet people quickly. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Orangemud You guys rock! Just ordered a hat — order # 8861. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Got home from 2.5 hour meeting in time to see a whole 6.4 seconds of @chicagobulls game. Neat. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Misplaced my @Orangemud water bottle. May have driven off with it on top of my car. That thing lasted a year+, my longest ever. Bummer. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @alanaaanoel I. Love. Birthdays. 🎉 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @runyononempty Just sayin' I already did. That just isn't the issue. But oh well. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @runyononempty Ah, see, I hate fantasy sports more than I hate the Yankees and Cardinals. Ha. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @runyononempty They already were. This signing alone doesn't signal that, IMO. It's not a bad pick-up, but I'm not excited about it either. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @runyononempty But I don't expect him to start at any of those positions. $56 mil for utility player who doesn't start every day is insane. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @runyononempty I do like him. But 4 years is too long and $56 mil is way too much. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> My reaction to Cubs moves tonight:

Sign Zobrist: Ehh.
For that money at that age: Ugh.
Trade Castro: Grr.
To the Yankees: Eff. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Cueballnewscow Not equipped for that at the moment. Someday. Hoping to run my second 50-mile race this coming spring. <Text_End>

And now my vacation ends and I'll struggle to get miles in again. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @allisonk08 You're welcome. 😜 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Make that 70 miles in 6 days. Just my 2nd 70-mile week ever. 

High week: 73 in January, 2013.

Tomorrow, I'll surpass that. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> When my long run ends at @McDonalds for lunch and I'm still sweaty... Yes, I'm feeling okay, but thanks. 👍🏻 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @bade_truck I shot today while waiting to take HS team pics. Air balled first shot. Ouch. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @bade_truck Damn, didn't realize. I haven't played in far too long. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @bade_truck Looks like it. Loved the "Why are you even reading this?" Ha. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @bade_truck Heck yeah, man! Do you play? PS: I plan to stop by the truck for lunch on Thursday. 👍🏻 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @zbailor No decision yet; gotta get back in shape and run a spring 50 first. But leaning toward Pumpkin Holler now. 100K option, too. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @zbailor That run is gonna hurt more than it should. Haven't been able to run as much as I'd like, but excited to just be able to run. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Vacation time. Tomorrow: A long run and some book reading. 

I party hard, you guys. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Price to Beantown? For $31 mil per year? Crazy. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Taking winter sports pictures after school for @wdnsports620, then I can officially start my vacation. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Matt_Browning24 Not bad, but not overly exciting. I don't expect Price (anymore) or Greinke, but... I don't even know what I expect. Ha. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Matt_Browning24 Good. Soler shows promise, but Baez would be the headliner there (from Cubs end at least). FO must not want to spend FA $. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Matt_Browning24 If it's Soler + Baez for Miller, I will not be pleased. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Matt_Browning24 Balls. Time to do my Shelby Miller research, I guess. I just know Soler's a guy we'll trade, then he'll hit 40 HRs. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Just printed tickets for Sunday's @okcthunder vs. @SacramentoKings game — my 3rd @NBA game. 🏀 <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @gigglerunner This will be my lowest mileage month in 3+ years. Don't worry; you're not alone! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> 50-miler #2 in 22 weeks.
100-miler #1 in 46 weeks...?

Gotta find time to train, but that's the new goal. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Really nice win, @ChicagoBears. Always nice to beat GB — on the rare occasions it happens. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mlcrittenden So funny. I saw that when you tagged the paper's Facebook in that post earlier. Good stuff! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mrs_vieyra Yep. Just came out last night. We saw it in Wichita. Loved it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @joshwood Yeah, he's in the final two seasons. I like the show. Haven't seen either of those, but I've heard good things. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @joshwood For sure. Did you see/enjoy Friday Night Lights? (the show, not movie) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @joshwood Antonio Tarver. I drew a blank. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @joshwood True, but the boxer in "VI" played his role well, so there's that. The actual acting/boxing scenes in Creed seem better than ever. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Cueballnewscow I like IV the best, for sure. Original was a close-ish second for me until I saw Creed last night. Never liked V much. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @joshwood I love IV, don't like WWE. Not that I speak for everyone. I enjoyed Rocky "VI," though it, too, was obviously a bit of a stretch. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @joshwood Pretty sure you're the first I've ever heard say that about the series, especially IV. Although I think most agree V was weak. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @joshwood This saddens me. Loved it. Creed was great as a sequel that isn't one, if that makes sense. Good on its own w/ a tribute to past. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @joshwood I hope you're kidding about IV. If not, please explain. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> My order of Rocky/Creed movies:

Rocky IV
Creed
Rocky
Rocky II
Rocky Balboa
Rocky III

<Text_Begin> My @wdnsports620 column this week is about dancing and includes a Footloose reference. Be proud, @mlcrittenden @EncoreDanceWKS. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Part of my job is to make boring things seem interesting. Well, let's just go ahead and call tonight a tall task. 😴 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @zbailor Yes and no. Considering Heartland 50 again in spring, then Prairie Spirit fall 50, then decide between the two for spring '17 100. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AHeat85 Don't even have a tablet. Is it yellow? 

I joke; I'm not quite that far behind the times. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AHeat85 Gotcha. I'm in the process of deleting apps lately vs. adding them. But if I ever get into a 100-miler, we'll see! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AHeat85 Interesting. Never heard of it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AHeat85 What does that mean? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I will run a 100-mile race sometime in the next 18 months.

Twitter counts as a written contract, right? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @subtlysultry Here's hoping. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @subtlysultry Nope. Not now anyway. Working 70-hour weeks as it is. Maybe someday. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @subtlysultry Easier said than done. Gotta make a living. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Woof. Hate losing, to the champs or not. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ktchurch13 Never! Hate when people give stuff away. I'm excited for you to see things; I'd never ruin it. :) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ktchurch13 Eek! I'm glad I asked. I almost mentioned a spoiler I'm still mad about several seasons later. 🙊 haha <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ktchurch13 Have you watched it all the way through before? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ktchurch13 I keep trying to convince Kami she'd like it. She never trusts me at first when it comes to TV shows, though. Ha. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Man, these Dubs are good. But let's go, @chicagobulls. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @wdnsports620: How does small town Kansas do a pep rally the night before state championship football game? With a bon fire. https://t.c… <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @runyononempty It would just sort of be a zinger at the end that isn't necessary... But funny for those who'd get it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Matt_Browning24 For once. Ha. Do need pitching, though. Hoping to have the most expensive No. 3 ever (Lester) one way or another. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Matt_Browning24 I'd question me if I was you, no worries. I saw Baez start hurt, Russell finish hurt; Castro's streaky. I like the group. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Matt_Browning24 With any manager but Maddon, yes. With him, only maybe. He'll throw KB in OF to start them all or rotate Baez/Castro. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Matt_Browning24 If it's me, no one I'm prepared to trade. One of the few times I'd rather just spend FA dollars for pitching. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Matt_Browning24 My 'pass' was RE: Baez/Soler. Don't know a lot about Teheran. His 2014 looks good. His 2015 doesn't, but I know he's young. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Matt_Browning24 Pass. Emphatic pass. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Made a hilarious reference in my sports column. But I fear not enough people would get it, so I'll probably leave it out. 

Devastating. <Text_End>

Neat. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Dear @NikeRunning,

There should be a description for a run in between "Awesome!" and "So-So."

"Good" would suffice. "So-so" is depressing. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @dancartertc Ugh, it's my worst distance. I've done 6 &amp; fastest is only 4:12. But I've run 1:28 Half, so I hate that I can't even go sub-4. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @AHeat85 Yeah, I'm not messing with the cold &amp; wind like you do. Especially coming off having a cold myself this week. Not worth it. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @AHeat85 I would only be running to win. Only 11 signed up. Shirts are ugly. I think I'll spend the $30 on Christmas instead. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Was contemplating local 10K on Saturday. "Real feel" temp for race time: -9 degrees.  NEGATIVE. NINE.

Good time for me to say "F that." <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Close one today, @WichitaStateMBB. How about a Top 10 spot + one more W before I get to see one in person vs Tennessee Dec 14. #GoShox <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MehganXO I didn't mention Walker, but it was with that in mind anyway. :) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @spncrpatterson To illustrate its insanity, I hope? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MehganXO Ha. I JUST tweeted a similar line of thinking. Sort of. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Whenever someone misuses the word ironic, I blame Alanis Morrisette. 

NONE OF THOSE THINGS WERE IRONIC. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @AnnabelleKnits I've never run in long pants. Guys don't have that luxury without looking weird. Yay for hairy legs. :) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AnnabelleKnits 50 is perfect. They say dress like it's 20 degrees warmer. Running when it's 50 makes it feel like 70. :) <Text_End>

Good thing there's Wichita State basketball to keep my fandom sane for now. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> All right, Josh McCown. I trust you now. Do your thing. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AHeat85 Ah, yes. Saw previews for Anchorman 2 last night. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AHeat85 Also, The Dilemma with Kevin James, among others. As far as "must-see," Old School? Rudy? Ha. I know, not HIS movie. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AHeat85 For sure. Also, he plays a Knicks fan. No Chicago sports references. Bah. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Saw Delivery Man with Vince Vaughn last night. Not great, but decent. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I will always believe a team is bigger than any one player, but I hate to see @drose out. Anxious to hear the MRI results. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @hazelllwong @runwithnikeplus 6:25 pace for almost 12? Sick! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @joshwood Gotcha. Cabrera back to 1B or Martinez? Or do they trade off between 1B and DH? <Text_End>

I WILL hit 50+ next year.

Tonight (1st run since): maybe 4. <Text_End>

2014 goals:

• 1st 50-miler in Fall

2015 (maybe):

• 100-miler? 
(or maybe not) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NikeRunning Not sure. Maybe a Jan 1 Half Marathon, but may start prepping for more Ultra stuff in 2014. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NikeRunning By eating all the food in the whole world, starting with a giant burrito after the race last night. :) <Text_End>

Just wanted to say that once. This time tomorrow, it will no longer be true. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @mikebstout ...it's also the # I had for my Half Marathon PR. Pretty sure it's good luck. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mikebstout Here's hoping. Side note: my favorite NFL player ever (Joe Montana) wore 19 for KC (your favorite team). You're bib # 19. Boom. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mikebstout Jerk! Ha. But seriously, I'd be fine with that if I knew I'd hit 50. Just start pushing me (literally) after 20ish. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> 20 hours, 51 minutes until my 2nd Ultra.

<Text_Begin> @runyononempty Appreciate it! I'll need it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @runyononempty Exactly. It'll be in the 25-30 MPH range most of the day... In a 12-hour race. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Saturday's wind will be brutal. I don't know how I'll do. I may struggle, I may get hurt, I may fail. 

But dang, I'm ready to run. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @djrussc @mikebstout Much appreciated. Should be fun! (at least for the first 3-4 hours anyway) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mikebstout You'll get it. I really want that 50. Trying to not let the number itself overwhelm me, but it's a pretty big number! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mikebstout Hey, good goals! I'll add those to my list of goals, too. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mikebstout Same for your first 24. Eek! Got a goal in mind? Or at least a goal for the first 12? ;) <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @mikebstout Ha, funny you mention that. I got pulled over on my way home after we ran together Saturday. Not for NOT speeding, though. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @mikebstout Fine by me. When you decide on any given race, let me know. I can't seem to narrow them down very well. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mikebstout Decision: Sometime next year, I'm either gonna run the same 50K/50-miler as you OR train like hell to pace you for 40+ of 100. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @LongRoadToIron Yikes, saw you had 666 followers. Glad I could fix that! :) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @runemz You're gonna do great! So pumped for ya! Cheering you on from Kansas. :) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @runemz Haha, I'll see what I can do! Do you have a goal for this weekend? I'll try to keep tabs on it during the day after my Halloween 5K. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @runemz 6/12/24 Ultra on Nov 16. I may try the 12-hour with goal of running 50 miles to earn belt buckle award. #yikes <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> My farthest run ever (for now) is 38 miles. May try 50 someday. Hard to fathom 100. Good luck to @gazelle74 &amp; @runemz at #JJ100 on Saturday. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @mikebstout Not a bad idea. Or I can just use the ones I have and maybe cut a finger off of them. Ha. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mikebstout Only gloves I have are the crap cloth ones Runner's World sent me. Ha. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mikebstout Ready as I'm gonna get. Race time ("real feel") temp is 38 degrees. I'll likely go long sleeve. Still not sure what to expect! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Katie_H7 I never saw that. Hmm. Just overly creepy/flirty + political (super judgmental) rants -- "disagree &amp; you go to hell" type stuff. <Text_End>

(hope not) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Comical, yet accurate realization: I'm not fast enough to run marathons. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @adamandkaren Yeah. I'd put in my last pre-marathon run; this was just a social gathering at local pizza place. I was geared up for pizza! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @sarahrsuttle Ha, nice! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @sarahrsuttle Yeah, the longer runs can be tough without company. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @sarahrsuttle I normally prefer it, but regardless of preference, changing things up always helps! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @sarahrsuttle Amen to that! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @lucyjuicy03 Ha, right. Just too old to read a clock, I think. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @sarahrsuttle No idea whatsoever. They're old and bored, I guess. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @sarahrsuttle I hear ya. I'm younger than everyone in this club. Faster, too, and I'm not even fast. Only option here, though! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @sarahrsuttle ...and now I'm hungry. Bah! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @sarahrsuttle I know! Already put in my last run before marathon on Sat; this was supposed to be just casual meeting at local pizza place. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Not sure why joined a running club if no one shows up to group runs/meetings. I've been the only one to show up 3 straight times now. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @JessePaine Once? He's been fined several times for several different dirty hits, though. Maybe once a week. ;) <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> This girl is my favorite. We ran 3+ miles together after work &amp; before going to get ice cream for her… http://t.co/FO384Wp6kL <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm almost more excited to dress up &amp; run a Halloween 5K together w/ my girlfriend than I am to run my 5th marathon on Oct 19.

Almost. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @jgthatcher Lol, thanks. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mikebstout @lacyjhansen Ha, no worries! No promises, but I'll do my best to go the whole way. 6:00? Same start like as last year? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @lacyjhansen Exactly why I won't be wearing them. I have another pair that isn't "short," but not basketball shorts either. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mikebstout @lacyjhansen 1. My shortest ones I just wore Sun won't get washed by then. Ha! 2. Man, now neither of you can spell my name. :) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @lacyjhansen If I run the whole thing, do I get to have my name spelled right? ;) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mikebstout I feel like that's a challenge. Ha! Depending on HOW "slow and easy," I'll see what I can do. :) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mikebstout Just occurred to me: When you say you/we are running the PFM route, do mean the Half or all 26.2? Might change what I take. :) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> My training last week: 6 workouts for 30.85 mi and 3990 calories burned http://t.co/k1OT6XHMGO <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mikebstout True story. 7 months later, I still can't believe I ever ran a 1:28:06 even while losing 20-30 seconds to tie a shoe. Ha. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mikebstout Mostly, yeah. Disappointing result, but it was to be expected. Lot less runners than last year, but I like that race. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mikebstout I'm almost more excited for ya than I am for KC in 26 days. If I was guaranteed a 3:59, you'd have 100% of my focus. :) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mikebstout Awesome 50-miler this weekend, man. 19 days left! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> More from yesterday's Half Marathon. Top left proves I have weird thumbs. Top right proves I'm too… http://t.co/K6rM4MPxe3 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Love seeing the Bears thrash the Steelers (or anyone, really). Hope they keep their foot on the gas. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @OGR47 I guess just running that much slower than my best is hard to swallow, but I can't be too upset. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Today's race =

•4 Half Marathons done.
•50 10+ mile runs this yr
•184 miles this mo; 4th most ever.
•1,497 miles this yr; 1,512 in 2012. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Run for the Rocks Half Marathon, post-race. First 4 miles were right where I wanted them, but this was… http://t.co/ZH8QQPzMUS <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Run for the Rocks Half Marathon (my 4th Half), pre-race. Lot of long, slow stuff lately; I was nowhere… http://t.co/bO4SfHtf5A <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Half Marathon result: 

Place: 20/351, 3rd in AG.
Time: 1:36:38 

8:32 slower than PR. Knew I wasn't ready &amp; it showed. Poor race, fun day. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kalhuillier9 Thanks! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KimertRuns Thanks! Tomorrow will be awful, time-wise. Just gonna try to have fun &amp; not struggle too bad. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Katie_H7 Thanks! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @renewhiteley Thanks! Tomorrow will be nowhere near those recent 2, but I'll try to have fun with it anyway. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @tealofapproval Thanks! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> My 3 Half Marathons so far:

April 2012 -- 1:56:31
Sept 2012 -- 1:31:32
Feb 2013 -- 1:28:06

Sept 2013 -- (TBA tomorrow) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Real feel temp for tomorrow's Half Marathon: 51 degrees. Perfect.

Now, if only I was anywhere near ready to race. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @CoachBruster Boo hoo. Poor fan of a playoff team. I'm not sorry. :) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Cubs now 15-5 when the girlfriend watches at least 5 innings. 

That win % over a full season would = approximately 121 wins. 

Just saying. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> 52-yard FG to win the game + an actual winning record? That's neat. 

@KUGameday <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @stephjdingman Thanks. It's tough knowing I won't be anywhere near a PR, but with local course, hopefully I can at least make it fun. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Just picked up my packet for tomorrow's @RunforTheRocks Half Marathon. I've done zero speed work &amp; expect disaster, but who knows. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AR_aces23 Yeah, I watched that back when it was on. Good show; wish it would've stuck around. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AR_aces23 I'm just about finished watching it all for the first time on Netflix. Once this episode ends, I'll only have 3 left. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Friday evening photo sesh with the lady. We played catch in the street until the sun went down. #love… http://t.co/1KTPLIqTzL <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> To self: I want a sandwich &amp; ice cream later. I should tell the girlfriend.

Text from gf 5 seconds later: "@jimmyjohns &amp; ice cream?"

Love. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> With that run, I hit 170 miles this month (6th most ever, so far) + logged my 110th 5+ mile run this year -- same amount as in ALL of 2012. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @runyononempty I definitely DO suck at lifting. Lol. I may not suck at running, just nowhere near as good at running as I am/was basketball. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @jgthatcher Thanks. That's really the only advantage running has over basketball, honestly. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @adamandkaren Ha, thanks. I just miss the game, and I was MUCH better at it than I am running. Can't do both well at the same time, though. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @runyononempty Hate lifting with a passion. Partially because it's boring, partially because I suck at it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Despite all my running, I often strongly consider quitting. 

I miss basketball. I'll never be half as good a runner as I was a ball player. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @thomasstanley @monaghan_adam Running 20 (+?) with @mikebstout on 9/28, but I think part of the PFM course. We should find a way to do both! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @monaghan_adam @thomasstanley Thanks! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kweidert13 Lol. No way. Not even a little bit. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mikebstout Same here. Sunday's Half won't be pretty. Really wanna PR marathon in Oct, then ICT Ultra. I'll worry about the rest later. :) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @monaghan_adam @thomasstanley Good! Hutch, but I may go test course out sometime before Nov. The 9:11 race was my 1st Ultra. That'll be # 2. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @monaghan_adam @thomasstanley Very cool. Um... Trail seems super narrow in pictures. Will I annoy big-time runners trying to pass all day? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mikebstout I'm leaning that way, too; wasn't sure how crazy that'd be. I've done 2 10-milers, and PR still only 1:11:29, so it's tempting. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ktchurch13 Heck yeah! Sigh... Growing up sucks. Lol. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mikebstout 2+ months away, but got an email about Turkey Trot. Love that race, but 8 days after 12-hour Ultra? 24 for you... Your thoughts? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ktchurch13 I miss those days a whole lot. PS: your new-ish avi is awesome! Very pretty. :) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @thomasstanley @monaghan_adam I'm going to do that one for sure (likely 12 hours). Wanna try for 50-mile "special award," whatever that is! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ktchurch13 Ew! FAT Derrick. That's just embarrassing... Probably closer to 7 years. Crazy! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @thomasstanley @monaghan_adam Very cool. I've just done the one. Hopefully I can eventually do a distance specific one instead of timed. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @SEisHere Ha, well sort of, I guess. But I also don't work Fridays, so Thursdays are like my Fridays. So a little sigh of relief there. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @SEisHere Ha. I was just thinking the opposite actually, but this made me laugh. :) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> 1 month until @KCMarathon.

But first: 3 days until @RunforTheRocks Half Marathon. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @stephjdingman I don't mind treadmills. Helps stay focused &amp; get faster. Hills was the yuck part. I signed up too early w/o thinking. Oops. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @stephjdingman Okay, so why is that terrible? 😕 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @stephjdingman Wait, why is it horrible? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @thomasstanley @monaghan_adam Wish I'd known. I would have asked him a million questions about it while in Olathe. Ha. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @thomasstanley Random question: Is your buddy the race director for the Nov Ultra in ICT? Name looked familiar. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Used treadmill's incline feature for first time tonight. No nearby hills to practice on for @KCMarathon, so that'll have to do.

Also, yuck. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @OohCrystal Oh no; not you, too. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Yes. We know it's "hump day." Enough with the camel pics already. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @OGR47 Haha, not quite. Goal is 2,000... Or maybe 2,013? 👍 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AHeat85 You can add me (same username as Twitter), but unless I eventually get NCAA or Madden, not sure when I'd get to play. Sigh. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AHeat85 360, but rarely get to play anything. Haven't bought a new game in ages. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AHeat85 I don't get not getting it... But, I just won my game of NBA Jam with Dr J &amp; A.I., so all is right with the world. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AHeat85 Don't be a hater. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> My girlfriend is cooking brinner &amp; letting me play a video game.

Love. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @mikebstout: It just now hit me that I'll be running my first 100 miler in a few short weeks... Thanks for the reminder @derkfor3!!! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mikebstout Sounds perfect. I know your "easy" is my sprint, but I'll try to keep up anyway. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mikebstout Can I invite myself, or is it too exclusive for out of town folk? :) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mikebstout Any idea what your plan for Sat, Sept 28 will be? 2 weeks before your 100 &amp; 3 before KC for me. I could use one more 20-miler. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ncgonerunning I know this. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It may be time to sign up for another Ultra soon. 

Yup, I know I'm crazy. Thanks. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Last year: 1,512 miles
This year: 1,466 miles

Today is September 17. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @CatClassof1989 @runpfm You'll do awesome! That was my 1st this year &amp; it was terrible. Wish I'd have done it again instead of KC, honestly. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> My training last week: 3 workouts for 50.05 mi and 6622 calories burned http://t.co/mcTcxd1M1Y <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @CatClassof1989 That'll have to be my approach. Otherwise, I'll wind up super disappointed. I do expect to PR @KCMarathon in Oct, though. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> 4th Half Marathon on Sunday. 

Times from first 3:

1:56:34
1:31:32
1:28:06

I've done zero speed work; totally unprepared. I expect 1:40+. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> While discussing possible 50K &amp; 50-mile races w/ the girlfriend, she asked "What's the farthest you'd ever run?"

I didn't have an answer. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> That's now 9x w/ 150+ miles in a month. September only half over, but planning some rest.

I've hit:

160+ 7x
170+ 5x
190+ 3x
200+ 2x <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @thomasstanley I'm not sure. I'd guess 10-15, but I'll see what he wants/needs me to do, I guess. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> • Half Marathon # 4 @RunforTheRocks in 7 days
• Pace @mikebstout in Heartland 100 in 20 days
• Marathon # 5 @KCMarathon in 27 days <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Patterson ain't no joke, you guys. Played college ball at HCC, about 2 miles from my apartment. So, there's that.

Still, go Bears. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MamaWitchyWitch Exactly. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MamaWitchyWitch "You should do things THIS way..."

Then I show them what I think THEY should do -- by not saying anything. 

Sigh. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> People who offer advice without being asked are never the people you'd ask if you actually wanted advice. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @stephjdingman Hey, little victories. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @thomasstanley Thanks man! I'd like to try. Pace for 50K in 6 would have to be faster anyway, so I probably might as well go for 12. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @thomasstanley Whoa, whoa! I had 9:11 to complete that 38 (36 officially). Need to decide if I'm capable of 50 in 12 hours before Nov 16. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Tiff0787 I said I still got one, and you said "You lost out those?" What does that even mean? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> 38 hours after running 38 miles, I ran 2 miles at a decent pace without falling down. 

That's a win. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Tiff0787 Huh? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Tiff0787 Untrue. Still got one. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @ncgonerunning Thanks so much! For being in near-100 degrees almost all day, I'll definitely take it! <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @stephjdingman Thank you! 🙏 <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @NikeRunning Personal-best 38 miles in my 1st Ultra -- a 9 hour, 11 minute race on 9/11. #humblebrag <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @andreasgossner Thanks! Race finished 3+ hours ago. Finished my longest run ever: 38 miles. I think I was 6th overall out of 20 or so. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @runemz Thank you! Don't forget to have fun on your 24-hour run! Excited for you! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @F3_community Thank you SO much for the opportunity! I think I was 6th overall out of 20 or so. Results &amp; pics tomorrow. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Today, I ran my 1st Ultra. 

Today, I ran 38 miles &amp; survived.

Today, I am humbled.

Today, I am happy. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mikebstout Here's hoping! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Today, I'm going to see what I'm capable of -- and then do a little more. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @runyononempty Appreciate it, man. You got it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @jill_darkknight It may already be in the way! Can't help it. Ha. But thank you! :) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> 9 hr, 11 min on 9/11 -- tomorrow is my 1st Ultra -- unless I complete less than 26.2 miles.

Then it's just a long, hot run.

No pressure. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ncgonerunning Untrue. Race starts at noon, lasts until 9:11 PM. I'd still have almost 3 hours to go at this time tomorrow. Eek! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ncgonerunning Haven't trained for an Ultra at all. Got the opportunity for a free entry &amp; took it. I'm not an Ultra runner; this is my 1st. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ncgonerunning Eek, sure hope so! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ktchurch13 We'll see. I'd love to do it, if I can accord to &amp; if I'm not burnt out! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ktchurch13 Yeah... Why is it 3 weeks later this year? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mikebstout Yeah, a few things. Plus, they'll have some there &amp; Kami will be around to bring me something, if needed. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ktchurch13 Thanks, I'll need it! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mikebstout Ready as I'm getting. The heat is gonna suck. Just wanna find a way to get 35. Gotta stay hydrated &amp; keep moving, I guess. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Tomorrow will likely suck in several ways. But as long as my legs are working, I'll keep moving.… http://t.co/H3SDSvEfr5 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @andreasgossner Yes sir! Especially since it's a timed race (9 hr, 11 min)... Not set distance. So no matter what, I'll finish. :) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @claremcneill74 Thank you! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @andreasgossner Means a lot coming from you! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Tomorrow: Ultra Marathon. ULTRA.

Holy smokes, what am I doing? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @adamandkaren I'd trade ya. I'm thinning in the back already at 28. Eek! The rest is cool, but that part sucks. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @adamandkaren And yet, mine is no match for yours. I'd be lying if I said that didn't occur to me when I posted this. :) <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @stephjdingman No kidding! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> My 1st Ultra Marathon is in 2 days, starts at noon, and the forecast is 93 degrees.

<Text_Begin> @tablefor3 I run for time in Half Marathon &amp; shorter, although I've gotten slower this year. I'm awful at the Marathon so far. Thanks! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mikebstout Ha! Maybe that's why we're friends. Brought together by mutual idiocy... Or something. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mikebstout That's because you're fast. And at least 75x more awesome than I am. :) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @tablefor3 Ha! No chance. That would be an epic waste of the money I spent signing up to RACE. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mikebstout I might have to go run Buffalo Park sometime before that November Ultra, though! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mikebstout If another comes up before your big race, let me know. Probably not wise for me just a few hours before racing a Half. ;) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mikebstout You did not. What/where is it? Run for the Rocks Half Marathon here in Hutch on the 22nd, though. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @onfiremother Not when it's MY chair at MY desk, it isn't. :p <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @onfiremother Mostly: Not putting the chair height back to its correct place when you borrow the chair of a regular-height person. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Hey. Short people. Knock it off.

K, good talk. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mikebstout I figured that'd be the case. Ha, I'd love to PR, but big bro is paying, so no biggie if I don't. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mikebstout Wanna pace me for 15K this Sunday? Ha! PR (only one I've done) is only 1:04:03. :) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mikebstout What a sissy. Ha! Just think what that 2nd week in Oct will look like. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @sarahrsuttle Well, now 8 MPH (I don't know anyone who measures running that way) would = 7:30/mile, or 23:15. Even better! :) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @sarahrsuttle 24:44 would = 7:59/mile pace. Just throwing that out there! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @sarahrsuttle That's all you can ask of yourself the first time. Then you'll do another &amp; have a goal to beat. ;) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @sarahrsuttle Still cool. Kick some butt! :) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mikebstout 91 miles in a week? That's just silly. I think I hit 68 or 70 once, maybe. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @sarahrsuttle It got addicting fast. It was a way to replace basketball &amp; stay competitive. What's your race? 5K? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @sarahrsuttle That's awesome! Very cool. I hated running until deciding to lose weight Aug 1, 2011. First race was a St. Pat's 5K Mar 2012. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @sarahrsuttle Considering I have my 1st Ultra next Wednesday, it's not smart. But he's trying to get back into running &amp; offered to pay. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> 3 races this weekend w/ big bro:

<Text_Begin> Correction: it was actually on Opening Day, but after the game. Still, she deserves an award. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Today marks 5 months w/ the girlfriend. 

We started dating April 2 -- the day after Opening Day; Cubs are 58-78 &amp; she still tolerates me. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Decent morning for a run. Got in 7.77 because the 7.62 back to my apartment wasn't cool enough.… http://t.co/nY35CvfFV5 <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @mikebstout I'm sure! What'd you end up with? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mikebstout Decide to go for 70?! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MamaWitchyWitch Ew, ew, ew. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MamaWitchyWitch Excuse me, I have to go throw up, then take like 11 showers just to get the smell of this conversation off me. :) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MamaWitchyWitch I'm fine with that. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MamaWitchyWitch Gross. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mikebstout I "only" ran 15 today, but I got 2 others to extend their 12 into 15 with me -- distance PRs for both of them. <Text_End>

2x in 2011
11x in 2012

Finished August with 172 miles -- my 5th most ever. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mikebstout You'll do great. Can't wait to hear about it! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mikebstout High of 101 here. Be careful! Don't kill yourself to get 50 -- especially when 41 would be a PR. ;) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mikebstout Have a good run tomorrow, man! I'll be thinking about ya while I'm running my 12-15 max. Can't imagine ever going 50 (yet). :) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I don't know what "twerking" means, but it sounds sticky. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Ericb260 Very cool that you were in the Navy. I'm sure you'll get back to that. Good luck! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Ericb260 That's not bad! Those labels are weird. At 6'2" I started at 232. "Ideal" weight supposedly 171. Got as low as 161, now at 175. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Ericb260 Much appreciated. That'd be great! Got any goals in mind? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Ericb260 All started small for me. Just setting goals &amp; building them up gradually. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Ericb260 Thanks man! Haha, I'm still just trying to shake plantar fasciitis injury. Hated running, decided to lose weight, now addicted. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> 157 miles this month w/ 1 day to go. 7th most in a month so far.

<Text_Begin> @AliceInPuckland Thank you! <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @mikebstout Ha, okay! I assumed the heat comment &amp; wink was a reference to when I had heat exhaustion after my 34. Oops! :) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @stephjdingman Tempting! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @tablefor3 Are you just randomly stalking our conversation? Ha, weirdo. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mikebstout Ohhhh, I get it. I just now realized I was being made fun of. Jerk. :) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mikebstout "Nothing really. I'm gonna run 50..." Ha. That's awesome! I'd join, but I think we're going to ICT Sat night. Tempting! Hmm. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mikebstout Nope. Thinking about running 12-mile group run here with the HM training group. Unless you know of something better?! :) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @enystedt Sounds about right. That averages to 23 &amp; 1/2 years old for the parents. Young, but not startling. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @stephjdingman Thanks! Still can't call or text, but hopefully I'll get that straightened out today. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Just logged my 100th 5+ mile run so far this year.

110x in 2012
17x in 2011 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Sept 7/8, I'll run 3 races in 24 hrs (3 days before 1st Ultra). Big bro wants to start running again; volunteered to pay. Whatever it takes. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @Katie_H7 Thanks. Me, too! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Katie_H7 Best case scenario: $160 to replace it. Bah. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Katie_H7 Water/sweat damage. In my pocket for 20 miles. Oops. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> No phone since last week; may not have one all this week. I feel like I've lost a friend.

<Text_Begin> @CubbieWanKenobi Should be cool to see Baez. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @tjeldridge24 I just finished Season 1 of The West Wing, a show I'd surprisingly never seen. Liking it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @em_lager It's only a problem if you regret it. So good! It's dumb they make Vanilla Pepsi/Coke in cans at the store, but not DP. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Hate resting 2 straight days, but hoping for 20 miles tomorrow. If that happens, it would be my 15th 20-mile run.

First Ultra in 12 days. <Text_End>

Maybe I'll conquer one someday. Eventually. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @katiecernek Ha, probably. I also feel like if I was gonna go THAT far, I might as well go to a coastal state, but I dunno. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @AJHeater Well, that makes one of us. Lol. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> You're all crazy. I like you. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @BullsBlog Yeah, on a 35-year old middle reliever to be named later who will either get hurt or play well &amp; get traded for cash. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AJHeater Still. Made zero sense to me, regardless how much people try to rationalize it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @BullsBlog Again, disagree as strongly as I can. Haha. I like you, man, but we're on opposite sides of the universe on this one. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @BullsBlog I couldn't possibly disagree more, but I appreciate the input. Lol. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AJHeater He was happy in Chicago. He would've won a ring last year had he accepted a trade, but wanted to stay. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Are the rest of you Cubs fans still glad we traded Sori? Possibly the best 2 games of his life on back-to-back nights. 

I'm just saying. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @caaataclysm I'm funnier, and a better dancer.

Maybe. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I think I may have finally decided on my 1st Ultra Marathon. I'm just too chicken to sign up. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> My training last week: 4 workouts for 31.95 mi and 4273 calories burned http://t.co/k1OT6XHMGO <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Apparently, it's National Middle Child Day. To celebrate, I hope you all take 3 tries to get my name right, and ask about my brothers. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @barbie_doll921 Thank you! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Last night was my:

25th 15+ mile run (12 this year)
14th 20+ mile run (8 this year) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @shayf_ Yup! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Coleen's 4th annual Sweaty Ass Run -- 10-hour overnight run. My goal was 40 miles, but the trail was… http://t.co/ariOiiLYER <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Got nowhere near my goal of 40 miles at all night trail run. Still 3.5 hours left, but it kicked my butt. Quit after 20 miles. Bah. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @jgthatcher Thanks. Just glad it's not a race. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @stnkrbelle80 Between you and me, I think you're safe. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> There is a "serving size" of 1 listed on gum. 

Because 2 sticks of gum make you fat, apparently. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @VintageBabe1212 Very sweet of you; same to you! 🙏 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @FavstarOfTheDay: Congrats @derkfor3! @VintageBabe1212 picked your tweet as Tweet of the Day: http://t.co/qUve4IQmez <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @VintageBabe1212 Wow, thank you so much! :) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @C_Fly_Run Replying to 2 tweets in 1... Great rule! I'll use that someday. Also, good run today! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MichiganGoat Thank you. So creepy. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Today, I attempt something crazy. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Cubs now 13-3 when the girlfriend watches 5+ innings. 

Also, opposing manager has been ejected in the last 2 of those games. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @bumlaser Yes, exactly! Uh, I think... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Knocked down 2 for 2 from 20+ feet out with neighbor kid's basketball. Now he thinks I'm a Globetrotter. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Katie_H7 Thanks! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> 10-hour run event 7 PM tomorrow - 5 AM Sunday.

Goal 1: Don't die.
Goal 2: Have fun.
Goal 3: 40 miles. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @jennywelker Ha! I've recently taken up coloring, although usually with the girlfriend &amp; AFTER work (not instead of) or on weekends. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senoritaquesita Bah. You're interesting. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senoritaquesita Cool, though! Must be the fun, new-ish username. 👍 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Hit 2k overnight, apparently. Neat. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Best feeling ever: Turning off the alarm before going to sleep.

If you disagree, it's fine that you're wrong. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Saw Monsters University tonight. Much funnier than Monsters, Inc.

In case you were wondering. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> In this edition of:

"I Don't Know What that Means &amp; I'd Like to Keep it That Way" ... 

TWERKING <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @jcoins Haha, no worries. Thanks! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Me: "Remember when the Pirates were really good?"

Most people: "Uh..."

1992: "Yep." <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @jcoins 30%? You must have long days! Ha. It's a 10-hour run/social gathering. My buddy is aiming for 60. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ReDHeaDeDTaRT Amen to that! I couldn't run 40 in a race (yet). Too much pressure. No pacing goals here; just gonna get out there &amp; go. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ReDHeaDeDTaRT It very well might. But I'd rather run 10 miles than climb 10 feet, so that's me. :) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Angielala527 I tweet about running a lot, but this made me laugh anyway. :) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ReDHeaDeDTaRT By continuously testing my limits. Not sure if I can or not. My buddy is going for 60. It's an overnight 10-hour run. Yikes! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> My most popular tweet ever is about cookies. If that surprises you, you don't know me. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I plan to attempt a 40-mile run this weekend. 40? Yeah, 40. 

Whoa. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @hankandlucysdad Haha, not surprised. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Do people from big cities also say "This is great; we need the rain" when it floods? Or is that a fly-over state thing? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> If the first word out of someone's mouth isn't "heresyourburritosir," I'm 73% less likely to be listening. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mikebstout So, together we're running 100, then? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mikebstout I already told the girlfriend I figured you'd go 60ish. Don't let me down! :) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Tonight was my 40th 10+ mile run this year.

55 all of last year. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mikebstout As if I need more reasons to go slow. Ha! Do you have a distance plan at all? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> That was a hot, sweaty 10. First run of more than 2 since 34.3 last Thursday, and last run before… http://t.co/iLIWfmlBci <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mikebstout I only walked about 1/3 mile from entrance &amp; it seemed super rocky + moderately hilly. I'm scared &amp; hoping it smoothes WAY out. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mikebstout Love it. I'm hoping for another distance PR &amp; would love to hit 40... 4 miles/hour! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mikebstout Legs almost back to normal &amp; foot actually feels pretty good. I'm definitely still in, although a little nervous. Dumb, I know. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @adamandkaren Me neither. Ha! That's why I'm putting it out there; attempting to hold myself accountable. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I've run races of 11 different distances. I hope to make that 15 before I turn 30. 

On the checklist: 50K, 50-mile, something in between. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Late night text from little brother was 2 words long: "Damn Cardinals."

That kid gets me. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mishakey Happy Birthday, miss! Hope you had a great day. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It's weird knowing the 1st Ultra Marathon I'll participate in is 100-miler (as a pacer), but still haven't signed up for one myself. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> This kid just said "Ow, my skin."

I have no idea what his injury is. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kingcribd Appreciate it, man. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kingcribd I know this. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @thugrunner Thanks! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> 32.1 miles lasted 8.5 months as my longest run. My new longest of 34.3 miles will last 9 days. 

This weekend, going down. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> 11 away from 2,000... 

Big money, no whammy. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> "If I make this shot, you a me a million dollars." - me, almost every time I shoot a basketball <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @tincanman2010 Good question, actually. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @CubsFan1023 He's wrong-handed. Born flawed. Ha! I kid. But there's definitely an "airhead" theme here. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @CubsFan1023 Bigger bust than Tebow, IMO. Some at least doubted whether Tebow's style would translate. Many were SURE VY would dominate. Ha. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @CubsFan1023 VY won't memorize the route to the stadium, let alone the 1st page of the playbook. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Packers signed Vince Young? 

GREAT news for Bears fans.

...and strip clubs in Wisconsin. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Legs almost feel normal today--almost. Forcing myself to rest while I continue to look into various options for my 1st Ultra Marathon. Eek! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @katiecernek No way. Otherwise, any player/team could claim injury to reduce actual suspension time. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @katiecernek A-Rod has admitted use before + lied this time + tried to recruit others + tried to buy evidence. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @jennywelker I hear ya. No sympathy for those guys. At least he didn't do it for over a decade, lie, try to buy evidence, etc like A-Rod. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Dear A-Rod: LOL.

Sincerely, 
Everyone <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> My training last week: 3 workouts for 36.47 mi and 5179 calories burned http://t.co/k1OT6XHMGO <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @mikebstout I'll be there! Whichever miles you want me for would be fine. We can chat about it Sat/Sun, assuming I survive that. :) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @thomasstanley True, I suppose. I still laugh at the memory of myself unable to jog a mile without stopping to walk. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @thomasstanley Oh snap, I should have guessed. Very cool. I wanna do an Ultra someday, but nowhere near that level. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Props to @andreasgossner for completing Stockholm Ultra 100K race. I'm just now considering a 50K someday; can't even imagine 100K. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Friends with cookies &gt; friends without cookies <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> This week's plan...

Sun/Mon/Tues: Heal + rest.
Wed: Run 5-7 miles.
Thurs/Fri: Rest.
Sat-Sun: Run 10 hours overnight + set new distance PR. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @thomasstanley @mikebstout Maybe YOU could. Ha, kidding. I ran the Spring PFM route at a decent pace 8 days before OKC. Are you pacing, too? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mikebstout Well, not sure I should do more than 10 regardless of pace, but I'd be happy to do that if needed. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mikebstout What are you looking for in a pacer for Heartland 100? I have KC Marathon 1 week later, but could maybe go 8-10 at 8:30+/mi? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @CatClassof1989 Totally understandable. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @CatClassof1989 I either plan another long one soon or sign up for a race. Anything to have something to look forward to &amp; take mind off it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @JeffreyDLutz Good thinking. Still, always cool to see Kansas kids up. And it's not like he can do much worse than most other options. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @JeffreyDLutz Stupid mistake. Knew he was from Wichita, forgot he didn't play there. Got excited, jumped the gun with my tweet. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @katiecernek I tell her that quite frequently already. Ha. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @katiecernek I told the girlfriend about your AB tonight (while sharing cookies). She thinks it's awesome. The end. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @spncrpatterson I vote disperse it evenly amongst all the other teams. Or build little league parks or something. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @spncrpatterson I agree 100% except I don't want the Yanks to be let off the hook for his contract, which would happen if banned for life. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Away from Twitter most of the day &amp; I lose followers. That's fine, I don't really want 2,000 anyway. 

Yes I do; come back. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> 40 miles next Saturday? There, now it's out there. It's still a question, but the idea is out there. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Negotiated w/ store clerk:

Me, sarcastically as I walked out: "If you make that Soriano shirt half off, I'll buy  it."

Him: "Okay."

Sold. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @runfastmama It was a blast. :) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Old lady helping at the race this morning was hilarious.

Just one example...

Me: "How many people finished?"
Lady: "All of them." <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @runfastmama Exactly! There was a 5k, too, but I had wobbly legs from 34+ miles on Thurs. Wanted to just have fun &amp; run w/ the girlfriend. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @bumlaser Thanks! This was just to loosen the legs &amp; run with the lady. Side note: Can I say blimey, or is that against the rules? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Today was my 15th top 5 overall finish + 10th top 3 overall finish. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Kansas CMA 2.5k. I did this race for 2 reasons: 1) To add another race distance that I've never done.… http://t.co/jZ8KocLWXl <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Spontaneous local 2.5k race: Finished 2nd overall. Only person to beat me was my girlfriend, who I got to run with the whole way. Neat. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> 4 month date with the lady. Pizza &amp; a movie. She also got me the most hilarious book ever + pictures… http://t.co/VcLRVao29f <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Eclipsy09 Happy Birthday, yo! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mr_joshhern Yup. I started VERY small &amp; have built them up gradually. They increase quicker than you expect when you focus on them. :) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mr_joshhern Thanks man! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Katie_H7 Thanks Katie! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ajwalsh08 Thanks! My goal of 35 would've done it. Didn't think of that at the time; I'm just weird with math. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Yesterday, I ran 34.32 miles -- or 60,403 yards. @DanMarino threw for 61,361 yards in his career.

I'll get you next time, Marino. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @stnkrbelle80 Awesome! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @stnkrbelle80 Don't think I knew you had a boyfriend now. That's exciting! :) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @stnkrbelle80 She's a blast. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Uhmazing_Amy Heck yeah! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> My favorite part about having an adult relationship: Acting like kids as often as possible. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Uhmazing_Amy Yikes, that's intense! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Thanks to everyone for the support w/ yesterday's run. It almost makes me feel less sore.

Just kidding, no it doesn't. But it's still nice! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Yesterday --
11th 15+ mi run this year (11 in 2012)
7th 20+ mi run (5 in 2012)
4th 26.2+ mi run (2 in 2012)

Farthest run ever: 34.32 miles. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @beckywads Thank you! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kweidert13 Not really. Just trying to stick it out; I'll be okay. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Uhmazing_Amy I wouldn't advise it. I'll be suffering from that run for several days. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kweidert13 You and me both. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kweidert13 How far did you go? I may not run for a week, at this rate, but planning to join a 10-hour group run in Olathe on Aug 10. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> After gaining 5.1 lbs in July, I lost 4.6 lbs on this morning's run. Crazy day. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Well, I did not meet my goal of 35 miles, and I'm not pleased with that. Every muscle in my body… http://t.co/UvA0QPRIt1 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NikeSupport Done and done. Thanks for your help! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NikeSupport Any luck? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NikeSupport Sport Watch, please. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NikeSupport Date: today, 8/1/13. Distance: 34.32 miles. Duration: 6:16:51. Calories: 4,544. SN: derkfor3 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @koalaslament: Don't act like you forgot about Savage Garden. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kweidert13 We've been over this... I've been taking time off. Aside from just quitting, I'm doing everything I can. :( <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Hit 1,000 followers on Instagram today, and almost at 2,000 here. You people are weird.

I mean, thanks. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @JessePaine Thanks man! PS: sorry for the delay on your shirts. They're on the way, though. :) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kweidert13 Thank you, Kayla! I'll be proud tomorrow. Maybe even tonight. Now, I'm embarrassed, pissed, in pain. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mikebstout Ha! Thanks, Mike. I'm stubborn; never really been worried about myself until today. Almost called ambulance. Embarrassing! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @paigeshitkicker Thanks, Paige! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm finished, but did NOT complete my goal. Whole body cramped up real bad, I fell &amp; couldn't get up for 10+ min. Had to quit. 

34.3 miles. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NikeRunning Just completed longest run ever (34.32 miles), but watch died at 28.08. Used iPhone for the rest. Can you combine them?! :) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Second loop done. 21.66 miles done -- my 7th farthest run so far. I have 13.34 miles left to reach my goal. They'll be SLOW. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> First loop done. 10.88 miles in the books. Steady 8:30/mi pace so far. "Only" 24.12 miles to go. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Today, I will run. A lot.

Later, I will eat. A lot. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mydmac Hey, thanks a bunch! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @TPJ13: A black man, a Mexican, and a Jew walked into a bar... it was an uneventful evening and they got along just fine because it's 20… <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @monks_19 All reasons to follow you twice. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @travelinjack Very cool! I lost 70.6 (too much), then gained 14-16 back on purpose. Holding steady now. Thanks for the positive vibes. :) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> August 1, 2011: I made the decision to say goodbye to Fat Derrick. Ran a bunch of miles, lost a bunch… http://t.co/DG01kKrj0t <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @macyjhawk I like clean. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @runemz Haha, I know... Just nervous! Shouldn't be since it's not a race, but still... Kinda epic for me -- for now. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @theawkwardful Not there yet, but closing in. Thanks again! :)

(that rhyme was an accident) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @theawkwardful Wow, thanks so much! :) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kgranato Thanks! It'll take me at least twice as long as you, but luckily, I'm not racing. Just taking the day off to run. :) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Hey, this 2,000 thing may really happen... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Tomorrow, I attempt my longest run ever: 35 miles. Girlfriend will run her longest (4) + her cousin will run HER longest (11) w/ me. Zoiks! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @JessicaVarsity: I don't need to wear a watch. It's always hammer time in my world. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ZombieGirlFun @JessicaVarsity Done! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kweidert13 I'll start by at least 5, but likely 4:30. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @megsridindirty I mean, I'll sure try not to. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MamaWitchyWitch Classic. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MamaWitchyWitch Which one(s)? I haven't seen that in way too long. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MamaWitchyWitch Ha! You like how I combined running + food in the same tweet? :) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> If I die trying to run 35 miles tomorrow, someone eat a big burrito on my behalf.

If I live, someone bring me a big burrito. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @gazelle74 Come run 35 miles with me tomorrow, k? Good talk. :) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Nefijer No problem. Right back at ya! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @Nefijer: Reach for the stars. Even if you miss, everyone will see how susceptible to clichés you are. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @XoMiSsYoX I may create a 2nd account just to follow you again. Ignore the nonsense. :) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AJHeater Love it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ZombieGirlFun Feel better soon, please! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Wanna know how to tell when someone isn't a "morning person?"

They'll tell you 53 times, that's how. <Text_End>
