<Text_Begin> It is not necessary to blow out someone else's candle to let your own shine. Share the Light! #HappyHolidays and #MerryChristmas! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Respecting other traditions and beliefs, though I may not share them, does not diminish my faith or lessen the miracle that is Christmas. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I confess that I'm not exactly sure what Kwanza is, but I suppose it could include that as well. I don't have a problem with that. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I always thought that it was meant to signify both Christmas and New Years. AND I thought that it also could also include Hanukkah. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Saying "Happy Holidays" does not make me any less a Christian or mean that I don't celebrate the true meaning of Christmas. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> I have lost next to nothing on the scale and measurements but have gained sore knees &amp; back. However, I have gained muscle &amp; strength. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Despite not missing a single day of exercising and drastically reducing calories for all but a few days, I have very little to show for it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I really wish it was easier to make the positive changes I need to make in my life. Not looking for easy just a little less frustrating. <Text_End>
