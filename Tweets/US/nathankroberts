<Text_Begin> @Midwest_KZ No. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @jk_roberts :) :) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @jk_roberts :) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> If the #Chiefs ultimately win this game, it will be because they forced a turnover. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Go make up for it Kelce. #Chiefs <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> No matter how bad it gets in KC sometimes, it's always worse in Cleveland. #blessed <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Christmas songs that should cease existing: Last Christmas, I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus, I Want a Hippopotamus for Christmas. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The #Chiefs just stared adversity in the face and refused to blink. Overcame penalties, injuries, and a first half deficit. Tough win. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Vertical passing game? Ok! #Chiefs <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Make a defensive adjustment. Taylor isn't exactly putting these things on target. #Chiefs <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Successful morning in North Central Kansas. @pheasants4ever https://t.co/3gESeCj0lh <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> KU really struggled to put teams away last year. Same story tonight. #kubball <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Finally beat Peyton the Bronco. Took way too many tries. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @joseph_highley This game should be over, but it's really not. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> You know, other than avoiding turnovers, I'm not sure the Chiefs offense has significantly outplayed the Broncos offense. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> So that's Tom Brady and Peyton Manning the Chiefs have gotten benched in consecutive years. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> One of the greatest of all time benched on the day he sets the record for most career passing yards. Wow. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Good news: Andrew Luck circa 2013 ain't walking on that field. Bad news: This game should already be put away. #Chiefs <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The Chiefs have not had a single thing go against them and only lead 16-0. Please just put this away! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Congrats, Peyton. An incredible career. Now let's beat him. <Text_End>
