<Text_Begin> hello, foreigners using work permit to work in another country will naturally has his pay lower than those who has citizenship there one la. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> all the good wishes from artistes in sm though.......... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> rather than suing sm, he should give money to sm instead, thank them for them popularity and then move to china <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> of course luhan can do better at china now but if not for sm, it would take years of even harder work to gain the popularity he has now. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> and ohmygod at lay's weibo lol <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> so judging from what everyone is saying, luhan is going to china to use the popularity that sm gave him to gain more popularity in china. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> errr......... excuse me. in the 1st place. luhan can't be popular if not because of sm. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> biting the hand that fed you <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> and what's with the weather nowadays seriously wtf <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @raichanxd: Without SM, your idol probably would still be nothing now. Hence you might not even know who he / she is. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> and luhan probably already has a china company out there supporting this lawsuit and in the process planning a solo debut or something <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> lol tbh. the amount of "un-popular" groups who are hoping to get as much schedules as the artistes in sm. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @slutmin: Complain when the group has nothing to do. Complain when the group does too much. They should have went to nugu companies then. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> 野心强 you know <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> i mean come on, look at how long zhang liyin stayed with sm <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> maybe the CHINESE members wanted more than whatever they're getting offered <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> if sm is really a money freak then sorry this is very contradicting because their stocks are going down like my grades in school <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> it's take 2 hands to clap, don't blame it all on sm just because you all are bias against sm <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @withryeo hehe i miss you <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> see, the latest news. like i said. the other 8 members might've felt that sica's heart was not with the team anymore so they "agreed" on it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> and for the sulli matter, i don't think they had a choice too. you think sm 有钱不要赚 is it. they could've let f(x) continue promoting for $$$$. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> god i really miss tweeting like this on twitter <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> going around all the supermarket at admiralty to clamper the price of vitagen because broke and every cents counts right now <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> ya and lol judging from what i'm reading and all, the other 8 members agreed to this so why people blaming on sm <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> in the 1st place it takes 2 hands to clap, sm won't nothing better to do just suddenly kick her out <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> sense. sure sm know snsd is very influential within the company, you think sm will 拿石头砸自己的脚. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @withryeo: @sicashxdes But for sm to kick someone out is 0.01% . Might be sometime really serious or a bad conflict <Text_End>
