<Text_Begin> @ZirgoTV I just had a beautiful Lost run, got The Hush down - but no angel rooms or Dad's Key -_- <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Thanks to the 5 new follows today while I streamed This War of Mine. Such an interesting game. I think I'm finally getting a feel for it... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ZirgoTV really weird.... maybe the old way doesn't work anymore and the wiki is wrong
https://t.co/Pow3q36o2I <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Running a little late, but pre-stream is up with some musics while I go hunt down my glasses - then This War of Mine https://t.co/49xL1doKFk <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ZirgoTV looks like the new way is dlc only... Maybe you made a mistake? Use your own bomb on Maggie? Killed by the right part of satan? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ZirgoTV it was changed in Afterbirth... I think you need the missing poster and die as Isaac in a sacrifice room... But not sure <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ZirgoTV FYI the pesky lost guy has some unlocks in Afterbirth that make him much more tolerable <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @ZirgoTV cause Alien3 was a cluster f00k of a production. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ZirgoTV i actually find the alternate cut off Alien 3 makes for a better film. At least there are parts of it that make more sense <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ZirgoTV although now I'm realizing I have watched half one version another - I guess I started the other cut when I restarted this morning. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @ZirgoTV old cartoons are my passage to sleep :p I just nod off overtime instead of tossing and turning <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I really wish more people in life saw the middle ground in more things... Very few things are truly one way or the other <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Laying on the couch watching old cartoons, typing into the void (occasionally at ppl that inspire me), &amp; pondering existence and life goals <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @LimaZuluTango congratulations on the level up fellow mathsquadian <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mattconn yeah I can see that. I do remember feeling way more in control of being stealthy... less frustrated when getting spotted <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Working through dvr'd Colbert and I'm convinced @neiltyson is the Barry White of science <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mattconn I want to say they had some... Involvement? I remember liking the improvements they made. Now getting hands on it... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mattconn yeah... Phrasing poor... Evening brain shutdown procedure had already started... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mattconn have you played the remake of the gc original? If not this is a good excuse <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ratscoat it's really nice when it works...infuriating when it doesn't... Like the game opening but the steam interface still showing <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ratscoat yeah they added it in beta a while ago, but it wasn't very good. They updated it recently though... My husband uses it  on his Mac <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @dexbonus when will bara-pod be? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @danielbtweets @GailSimone how about disney princesses replaced with baked potatoes.... I'm sure it'd be an interesting twist on the movies <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> okay introspective potato deactivated, time to write some more <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> oh and to all the awesome @MathSquad_AK who love to break down games and stories... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> anyway - so thankful to them, and the players at @RealRollPlay for being so inspiring <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I think this is the core reason I had so much difficulty trying to run a Paizo adventure path, and why I got so frustrated after a while <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> biggest thing I've learned from watching @Silent0siris &amp; @skinnyghost run &amp; talk about rpgs on twitch - don't write plots, write characters <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> sittin here - havin coffee, writing about halflings <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @ZirgoTV I'm not sure I'm ever totally satisfied with anything... or if that's a good or bad character trait... it's a trait though... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> 45 mins until more Diablo 2 #stream! Let's see if we can finish off Act 3 today! https://t.co/49xL1doKFk <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ZirgoTV my thoughts kind of got splattered onto twitter as I watched last night <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Time to keep sharing my Read Only Memories play-through! I snicker at drink names, &amp; make presumptions... https://t.co/IaNIt4KzcD @ROM2064 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @potato_fishy Also all I could see when the t-1000 was being shot was spray-painted yorkshire puddings... https://t.co/75gXv7RFTv <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @potato_fishy and the special effects were definitely better in the second one... I just like the script and tone of the first one a lot... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> yeah I think Terminator &gt; Terminator 2... just cause the first one never made me roll my eyes. The sequel did have it's moments though... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Plague of Shadows affords me both action &amp; silly voices!  There is that "Learning Curve" though (or I'm a boob)... https://t.co/eatBWbcCpw <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Okay... so why has the T1000 decided it needs to "wear" a helmet? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> also kind of feel like the T2 T-800 has a little too much personality... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @inspectorbeans silly real-life always getting in the way :D <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ratscoat I'd gotten other ones before... just not that one... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I will say if anything, I now get a Simpsons reference that I hadn't before: https://t.co/MIJ0cVJFsV <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ratscoat I think that's exactly what my opinion is boiling down to. The dialogue in the 1st one was very natural feeling... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm withholding judgement until I'm done the second movie, but so far I like the first Terminator film more #ProbablyUnpopularOpinion <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Time to get a Read Only #Twitch #VoD on YouTube! Part of me longs for when I was voicing only 2 characters https://t.co/4G0vroYp5r @ROM2064 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ZirgoTV I think you get... 60 or 90 days... I should have did it when I felt like I was getting behind. Recording locally now though <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ZirgoTV it's there - I paid for a month of turbo after I lost that episode of FF6 so I could catch up <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mattconn it ended up being some nom-y home made hot chocolate - exactly what I needed :D <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ZirgoTV also - fyi it's still not over on YouTube... I got very behind <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ZirgoTV hehe there's not a lot of that yet... about to the first part of Read Only onto youtube... once I eat &amp; write a description for it <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Fun stream, not so much for my voice - there is a lot to read outloud in read only memories. Anytime, time to get some tea or something <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @FaithErinHicks That's awesome! Congrats! <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @madpierrot see that's a nuanced opinion... I don't disagree despite not liking the newer sound. Unfortunately many ppl aren't so skilled <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @madpierrot pre-hiatus FoB? Or are we talking the more recent stuff <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @madpierrot some people very closely identify with specific media and then take it very personally when that media is criticized <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @cyberpunkwarlok well then... learning this is a thing #goodGood <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @VeryUncreative @Silent0siris I'd argue you don't need to know how to play if (a) you have others that do &amp; (b) you don't get hung up on it <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Plooper747 @Silent0siris as a separate entity is what makes watching an rp show so much more than watching a bunch of ppl do their thing. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Plooper747 @Silent0siris that aren't the most tactically sound but make more sense for the character. Being able to see, say, BonBon... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Plooper747 @Silent0siris I feel like accents is a function of letting yourself getting lost in the character. Same with making choices... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Silent0siris for someone super interested in getting into rpg streaming, this has a great amount of my attention <Text_End>
