<Text_Begin> @partialmitch @rron007 @JesabelRaay I think the tone will be closer to the SDCC trailer we got <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @niklander2 @DDoherty_ lets just say Kylo is more intimidating. But Snoke had a limited role so it's not really a fair comparison <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @partialmitch @rron007 @JesabelRaay exactly trailer can be very misleading <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @JesabelRaay @rron007 and jokes <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @rron007 @JesabelRaay the tone is the same as the last 2 just they have 2 jokes. Jokes don't change the tone of a movie <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @rron007 @JesabelRaay it really shouldn't have. It had the same tone and every thing from the CC one just it showed DD and the trinity shot <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @JesabelRaay @rron007 I don't believe that for one second. Yes they love marvel but no critic have reviews for BvS written up already <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @rprez2012 and I have full confidence that he will become that <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @rron007 @JesabelRaay and not even from the trailer. By the set pics and Ayers tweets to CC. It looked like they all really bonded <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @rron007 @JesabelRaay well it won't be iron man because it's a different type of film but I bet what you are saying <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @PaulRom95 @starwars I didn't ask you, but if they stick with that name then it's stupid. Just call is Star Wars: Rogue One. It's easier <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheMovieGuy1194 but I guess everyone has there own opinions <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheMovieGuy1194 while it does have some bad dialog and some bad acting on a whole it's way more good then bad. IMO it gets to much hate <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @starwars what's the Official name of Star Wars: Rogue One? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheMovieGuy1194 I find the first 2 to be really disappointing SW films and bad films in general, but Ep3 IMO is a great film <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @Jay_3085: I fucking hate screen junkies, cinema sins and how it should of ended YouTube channels. Pretentious Reductive nitpicky bullsh‚Ä¶ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheMovieGuy1194 @untamedbananas respectfully disagree, and you know how big of a SW fans I am <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @EmperorBenjie @Retrohan @terrance_may MOS2 people have been asking him about that a lot, or Green Lantern <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MichaelTweaton that's not what I'm saying <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> If the prequels were judged on their own and not against the original trilogy would they still be hated as much? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @InHiding626 the 2nd half of S5 and S6 have been really good IMO so far <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @terrance_may my 3rd favorite Snyder movie <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @InHiding626 why did you stop? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @InHiding626 I feel like Spectre wasn't the end for him, but if Bond leaves Sony then it was probably his last film <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @rron007 @TheMovieGuy1194 @darthtardis I don't think so, it didn't have 5/6 trailers and 20 tv spots like TASM2 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AquamanShrine who said this? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @rron007 @TheMovieGuy1194 @darthtardis that they showed to much? No I don't think they showed enough <Text_End>
