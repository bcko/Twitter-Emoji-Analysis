<Text_Begin> #SonicAllStarsRacingTransformed #livestream starting in 30 mins @YouTubeGaming.  Come #race with us on #Steam!  https://t.co/wYCscY10vA <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @YouTubeGaming didn't account for Daylight Savings Time ending!!!  No worries the stream is still happening tonight and I'm not late!!! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I sense a visit to the evil dentist may be in my near future... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Alright, enough procrastinating, I gotta go get ready for work...  Hope everyone has a better tomorrow.  Today was kinda poop... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> If you guys wanna race with us tomorrow @YouTubeGaming, you can get the game here for $20.00: https://t.co/4Cb2R66ULA <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I feel like I woke up to a really crappy day across the board.  Perhaps I should crawl back to bed and try for a do-over... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @twitter @pkmnrt New?  The star did the exact same thing. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ScarletDrkGames Incidentally they also changed "Favourite" to "Like".  What is this, FB? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ScarletDrkGames I am not faving this because I like it.  I am faving I understand it and agree with what you mean 100%. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ScarletDrkGames Erg, I was on my phone and it was still a star and I was like, oh good.  But now on the compy it's a heart... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Lack of daylight savings is messing with my bio-clock. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> There we are.  All courses and, of course, Dr. Eggman unlocked.  That was a long #livestream that nobody watched. :P <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Boy, do I ever love this game.  https://t.co/jl6bYpsGGd <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Just hangin' out, unlockin' stuff.  https://t.co/jl6bYpsGGd <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Not a regular #stream. Watch me play and prepare for Wednesday's #livestream, come check it out @YouTubeGaming.  https://t.co/jl6bYpsGGd <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Miss the #livestream earlier?  Catch all the #epic #Pokemon #LeafGreen #Finale #action in the #archives @YouTube! https://t.co/rrD2JbK1Yu <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I just realized I have a few giftable games in my Steam Inventory.  Perhaps I should have a #giveaway some day. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Some people like to smatter their #streams with all kinds of #doodads and #widgets.  I feel it's way too cluttery.  I like mine au naturel. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm strongly considering the "Add a camera," feature of @YouTube Live Events.  Would require a 2nd streamer or more.  Cool for races though! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Damn it #BobRoss , I have to go unlock all the race tracks for Wednesday...but I can't stop watching you... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Someone cue up the Metroid item get music: I have gained my first patron tonight!  Woo woo! https://t.co/DXQMKRwGey <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Ow. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @NintendoAmerica: Reminder: The Nintendo eShop is going offline for about 24 hours of maintenance. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm going to need to put this on the actual TV and curl up on the couch with a big ol' comforter... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Damn that soothing voice and my love of arts and crafts... &gt;&lt; <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @pkmnrt You're welcome to join us again if you can at the very least get on Skype. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ScarletDrkGames Squeeee  He said "Happy little cloud." <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @FallingStardusk Wow! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I have just been reminded that now that Hallows End is over it's just about #eggnog season!  Hells yeah! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ScarletDrkGames #BobRoss is a badass.  He can paint happy little trees in front of a camera.  I can't even type if someone's behind me! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Now that my shameless self-promoting is out of the way, what's the good word tonight everyone?  Cheers to you guys! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @HoaxiShankYou I figured it was you. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @HoaxiShankYou Whoa, that's an interesting Twitter handle ya got there.  :) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> And finally on Thursday at 5 PM EST we'll be saving the day in #FreedomPlanet @YouTubeGaming. Looking forward to it! https://t.co/qM619Ybb8M <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Then, on Wednesday 5 PM EST: #Sonic &amp; All-Stars #Racing: #Transformed for #Steam @YouTubeGaming. https://t.co/wYCscY10vA  Race with us!!! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Hello Poke-Fans!  The #Final #Pokemon #LeafGreen #Livestream will be happening tomorrow at 5 PM EST @YouTubeGaming.  https://t.co/EAyC0Y6MkC <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Time for the evening spam!!! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ScarletDrkGames That was good though.  Did those pictures ever make the rounds on #twitter though? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ScarletDrkGames Bitch, you owe me a new keyboard.  And some more wine. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Why does everyone hate Chi-Chi?  I think she's flippin' awesome. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> More test streaming hoooo! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Morning, all! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> G'night all. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I need to stop striving for perfect quality like recorded video...but I can't help it damn it, I just want it to be great...  #grumble <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Hmm...  To stream at 1080p 60 fps and suffer some compression or 720p 60 fps, which looks decent enough.  1080p30 also is okay-ish... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Blargh! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Also it was making me mad at my ISP.  Pay for 20 Mbps upstream, only get ~10...  #rogers <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Alright, that's enough of that.  It's consuming all my extra drinking time! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Lock-on technology, ENGAGE!!! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ScarletDrkGames Mind. Blown. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ScarletDrkGames Or does the anime get the you blush? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ScarletDrkGames It might be the wine, but I just laughed out loud at this. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Oooh, I fixed the Sonic 2 shield animation issue with streams.  You have no idea how much that bugged me. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Gonna #stream test some #SegaGenesis stuff @YouTubeGaming.  Bored enough to #watch?  Link goes here!  https://t.co/jl6bYpsGGd <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Oh wait, I know something I need to stream test still!  Quickly Robin, to the #Genesis!!! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ScarletDrkGames Done and done! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Now, my glass is empty, and that simply won't do... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Okay, I'm sufficiently impressed with that stream test.  Rookie mistakes were made! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @ScarletDrkGames: Does anyone know of any good guides or help with Tumblr? I'd like to use it to flesh out all of my RP characters. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Wow.  What a difference in quality and delay.  Only ~15 seconds between the what I see and what folks on @YouTubeGaming see.  I like. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> If anyone's bored and wants to watch some random stream tests, I'll be doing them here: https://t.co/jl6bYpsGGd <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ScarletDrkGames I've got whiskey I could switch to though. :)  *Clink.* <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> That explains the random graphical hiccups and only rendering at 30 FPS instead of 60...  Guess I'll do some tests now... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ScarletDrkGames Happy day after Hallows End!  Cheers! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Well, don't I feel like an idiot.  My streaming software was set to use software transcoding the whole time...  D'oh!  No wonder!!! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ScarletDrkGames Just wine for me tonight.  Shoulda got real booze... But I wanted to be "Classy." <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> In playing some #Castlevania earlier it was shown to me just how bad age has dulled my video game skills... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> 9 or 10 year old back in the day: MLG Pro.  9 or 10 year old today: can you beat this for me? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I still love Kara! https://t.co/VEtQALtEcR <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Also, it's raining now, but there was no snow this time!!! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> All the kids were done trick or treating before it was even dark out...  Something about that just bugs me... #halloween2015 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I should probably get Symphony of the Night on my PS3 and play it somewhat properly, prefer the original though. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I think I'm in love.  #SuperCastlevaniaIV <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Care to watch some failing?  It's gonna happen.  I don't know what I'm doing!!!  #SuperCastlevaniaIV @YouTubeGaming. https://t.co/jl6bYpb5hD <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I wish I was actually good at #Castlevania... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ClementJ64 Also the grammar in the thing below it hurts my brain. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ClementJ64 still seeing ep 1 on Canadian App Store.  Ep 2 is gone though. https://t.co/lP6YKz24AG <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Happy Hallows End everyone!  Crasher-Vania (CASTLEVANIA ANIMATED MUSIC VIDEO) - Starbomb https://t.co/fs825O7ZQw via @YouTube <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Happy Devil's Night everyone!  Here's a song I recorded a few years back called 'Zombies' on #SoundCloud https://t.co/gkX5dBnjzo <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Man, I kinda wanna #stream a #Castlevania game or two tomorrow, but god damn do I ever suck at those... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @SindelPellion Oh my. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Man, I should eat some wasabi before each stream so that my nose is nice and clear.  Eesh, think I just blue out my sinuses! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I was once taught to use chopsticks by a master of the craft...  Let's see if I can still remember how... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @roxiqt @Alreesa92 Still one of my favourite helms! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @sonic_hedgehog Awesome Jon Pertwee costume! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ClementJ64 Daaaaamn son!  That is one horny toad! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @SindelPellion Given that I've never known you to be one, personally, I'd say there's a lot of room to grow. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Miss the #stream last night?  Enjoy some #SuperMarioMaker archived here @YouTubeGaming! https://t.co/OZdT857oaO <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Oof. Sorry about some of the graphical hiccups in the last stream. Not sure if @YouTube or @elgatogaming beta software at fault on my end... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Goodnight everybody!  Work beckons! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ...I don't think the nap is gonna happen in the next hour...  How was everyone's day? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Now...should I try to squeeze in a quick pre-work nap?  Hmm... <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> I need a haircut, bad, but i wanna sleep more... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ButtersStotchL 2!  Best one!  You have to unlock 3 &amp; Knuckles, but that one is amazing too. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Don't forget!  #Pokemon #LeafGreen #livestream 7 starts tomorrow at 5 PM Eastern @YouTubeGaming!  https://t.co/wvG6O4zqDX <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> #Art updates to go with the #thumbnail change to both my @Twitter account and @YouTube Channel.  Bit much?  https://t.co/MtzcPBJ0bK <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> An oldie but a goody!  Timewalking with @ScarletDrkGames! https://t.co/1pyPAo6cx1 via @YouTube <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Now to wait for @YouTube to update my thumbnails... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Gonna colour code thumbnails for fun!  Blue for regular Let's Plays, green for live and orange for reviews (they may be a thing soon)! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Finding a really great font is half the battle... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Might be time to spruce things up a bit. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Like #games? Like #videos? How about videos about games? If so, as #Eggman would say: "GET A LOAD OF THIS!" @YouTube https://t.co/MtzcPBJ0bK <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> If my @YouTube Channel ever gets to 500 #subscribers I will totally do a #giveaway as a thank you.  Probably a #Nintendo #eShop code. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ScarletDrkGames Now you gonna get warts or something. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ScarletDrkGames I remember back in, I think it was vanilla, there was something like this with the Undead on the beach beside Booty Bay. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ScarletDrkGames Wow.  That's something! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Sheesh, it's cold!  *Puts on wool jacket.*  That's better.  (Pants still optional.) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ScarletDrkGames Jeeze, that's a lot of gnomes.  I'ma need new punting boots... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Every Saturday is glorious 'cause I get to #DoctorWho.  Unless it's the off season, then I just sit there and shake until the next series. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I hope our Dollar recovers soon.  Being 75 cents for every US Dollar is really depressing.  Stuff is sooooo expensive now.  Fucking Harper. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Reasons taking pre work naps is a bad idea:  1) Waking up. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ScarletDrkGames damn, i was thinking about this one.  :) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Sometimes, late at night, i miss Karazhan... #Warcraft <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ScarletDrkGames I still need to do My 5 on everyone sometime this weekend.  Niblette will be fun! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ScarletDrkGames Oh well then a healer was pretty much useless.  I did next to nothing when we ran with my resto druid.  :P <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ScarletDrkGames I don't know who you were tanking on, but I can vouch for at least Xai's unsquishiness. :) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Oooh, RPG Maker MV...now that's tasty...  Now to wait for you to go on a real sale! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ScarletDrkGames Any sign of the seahorse? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ScarletDrkGames Not gonna lie, that whole zone had a lot of creepy stuff in it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> #WonderTrade, why am I not lucky with you like other people? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> "It's only disrespectful if it hurts your feelings," is not a good mindset to have in any situation. Trust me... <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Also REALLY beautiful.  I love games like this. #FreedomPlanet <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @ScarletDrkGames At least they have those really comfy looking hoodies! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Oh Nvidia...  Your business practices are questionable many a time... https://t.co/1qoSlJjp6l <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> To be honest, there are things I enjoy about the game, it's just a little broken, is all. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I wonder how many people would want to watch me suffer through #SonicBoom: Rise of Lyric.  Let me know and it might happen @YouTubeGaming! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Must...stay awake until...at least 6 AM...  Only had like 15 mins of sleep...  Urgh... <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @ButtersStotchL It's the archives they go after, is all. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Considering joining a network for the protection, but I don't want to feel obligated.  I just want to have fun.  :( <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm not a partner and don't monetize. Copyright strikes scare the crap outta me and Nintendo is aggressive! Fun games to show off though! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ButtersStotchL Business reasons. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I think I'm going to have to write a letter to Nintendo... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Thanks for helping out as moderator @ButtersStotchL. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @elgatogaming Not disabling game audio when I push the live commentary button...  Otherwise I love it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Thanks so much to everyone who came out and made the #SuperMarioMaker #LiveStream another great success!  I really had a great time! <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @ButtersStotchL But I never give up!  You're all set.  The URL we were looking for was https://t.co/uDqW3OthNk <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ButtersStotchL Nope. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> #MarioKart8 going #live @YouTubeGaming in 15 minutes!!!  Let's race!  https://t.co/rnILUQvzaC <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ButtersStotchL Both not found. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ButtersStotchL When you click My Channel on the menu bar from YouTube what URL goes in the browser's address bar?  That's what I need. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ButtersStotchL The specified user does not exist. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @OBSProject: Watch out, there's a fake OBS plugin going around called "HLS Transcoder" that installs malware on your system. https://t.c… <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ButtersStotchL It's not saying you don't exist this time, it's just not adding you. :( <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ButtersStotchL Still notta.  I don't think it likes you.  I added 2 other mods just fine though! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ButtersStotchL Nay, the URL, not the e-mail.  For example like mine:  https://t.co/iJjeIqlv0x <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ButtersStotchL If you give me a direct link to your YouTube channel I can use that.  It still won't let me add you. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ButtersStotchL this is a decently priced site.  I've bought Genesis games from them.  http://t.co/kuHLwt7AHm <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ButtersStotchL good lord! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ScarletDrkGames Give him the broken glass sandpaper with no lube treatment! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ButtersStotchL Anything older than the Wii is horribly marked up in price right now thanks to the Let's Play / "Retro" gaming craze. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Rev your engines, guys! In just under 2 hours from now the #MarioKart8 #LiveStream will be starting @YouTubeGaming!  https://t.co/rnILUQvzaC <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> See you at 5 PM Eastern tonight for the #MarioKart8 #livestream @YouTubeGaming!  Let's race!!!  https://t.co/rnILUQvzaC <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> And they only attacked me.  And all suicided on sudden deaths. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm pretty sure I was just fighting one person playing 3 characters online in #SuperSmashBros.  Only one person seemed to attack at a time. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Ah, routing #audio so that #Skype is on it's own separate channel will be good for multi-person #commentary #recording and #livestreaming. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Sorry for the short notice!  Come play #MarioKart8 with me @YouTubeGaming tonight at 5 PM Eastern.  #livestream:  https://t.co/rnILUQvzaC <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> But, for me, it's still fun and totally worth it.  I just wish I could afford to take on all the requests I get... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> A lot of people ask me how much money I make from my videos.  The answer is a negative number.  I'm not a partner nor do I monetize. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> That does it.  #MarioKart8 #livestream with #Twitter followers and #YouTube subscribers is definitely something I want to do.  #ambition <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> At least I'm not coming in last... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @elgatogaming Instant Gameview rules. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Brushing up on my terribad #MarioKart8 skills over here @YouTubeGaming https://t.co/jl6bYpsGGd.  Not a regular stream, I'm just bored. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @FallingStardusk @Alreesa92 @serialxseven Wow!  That is so cool! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Have your course codes ready, #SuperMarioMaker #LiveStream 2 starts Thursday at 5 PM Eastern @YouTubeGaming!  https://t.co/75iph6GvE6 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm terrible at it, but lately I'm in a #MarioKart8 kinda mood...I still don't have the DLC though.  #SuperSmashBros always eats that budget <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ScarletDrkGames Ooh, that's pretty! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ScarletDrkGames i always wanted a pair of red sneakers...  But i never found the right pair... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Very pleased. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ButtersStotchL https://t.co/jl6bYpsGGd <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ButtersStotchL Yessir. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ButtersStotchL Heh, I just was playing some live to test my hardware.  Looks good so far! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I should totally #livestream some #MarioKart8 with friends/subscribers / followers @YouTubeGaming sometime.  Could be a lot of fun. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Doing some hardware adjusting over here!  https://t.co/jl6bYpsGGd <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @CartoonFanBoy @DisneyChannelCA Thanks!  Not a terrible show to end on!  Still sad though. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @ButtersStotchL Have you tried Thwomp Stomp Romp?  That one's pretty easy if you're quick!  Double-Crossed is fun, imho. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Hey @ButtersStotchL, thanks for the comment on my course!  Keep at it, it IS winnable. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Anyone wanna trade brains?  I think mine is broken...sure feels that way! <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @ScarletDrkGames But I am already in my pyjamas... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Man, I've been really lazy with the Let's Plays lately...but I'm loving the long live streams 'cause I actually get to interact with people! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Fish don't stink!  Underwater, the fish don't stink! New #SuperMarioMaker level.  Time to get wet!  5BD2-0000-0098-F558 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Uploaded a simple little #SuperMarioMaker course, was the first one I made in the game.  Danger Zone: 22CD-0000-0098-8521.  Enjoy! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Just uploaded a simple little #SuperMarioMaker course to the #Miiverse. Try out A Burning Sensation:  1E3F-0000-0097-AC82! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Speaking of #SuperMarioMaker, if you missed it live, watch it archived @YouTube!  https://t.co/QWxLz64sJM <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Wow, Nintendo copyright claimed the crap out of the #SuperMarioMaker archived stream video.  Good thing I don't monetize my stuff. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Well, now that I've played lots of people's levels in #SuperMarioMaker, I'm off to go make some of my own for them to play!  #Yay <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Join me next week for #SuperMarioMaker @YouTubeGaming. Keep the sweet levels coming, guys!! 5 PM Eastern, Thursday!  https://t.co/75iph6GvE6 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @pkmnrt Feels that way, don't it!? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @pkmnrt Did I miss another one?!?  :(  Sorry... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ButtersStotchL Thanks for helping out Butters! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Thank you so much to everyone who came to the #SuperMarioMaker stream!  All of your levels were super fun!  We'll do it again soon, k? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> #SuperMarioMaker #livestream going strong over @YouTubeGaming.  Some awesome levels, some hair pullers!  https://t.co/hokgGcnzSh <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I started a live stream on @YouTube: http://t.co/FW0DNmh2S1 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> #SuperMarioMaker #livestream @YouTubeGaming starts now!  https://t.co/hokgGcnzSh <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> #SuperMarioMaker #livestream will be starting in just a few short minutes @YouTubeGaming.  What fresh Hell awaits? https://t.co/hokgGcnzSh <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Ack!  I just discovered my channel has 999 views!  Yay! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Sleep time now!  See you all in a few hours for the #SuperMarioMaker #livestream @YouTubeGaming!  5 PM! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> If you're bored enough to want to watch the test stream, it's over here...  https://t.co/hY8msdFwrm <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> #SuperMarioMaker #LiveStream will be going live at 5 PM!  Come watch me fail harder than ever.  @YouTubeGaming https://t.co/hokgGcnzSh <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Okay, it looks like I have some decent enough stable settings now after hours and hours of trial and error...  Phew! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ButtersStotchL I'm preparing to throw something out the window.  :P  But yes, yes I am. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> And now the audio is horribly out of sync...fantastic... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Even more cranky that #Elgato HD60 Pro isn't available in Canada yet... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> My #AVerMedia LGX relies on my CPU (or other external encoder) for encoding, which is kinda dumb for what it cost... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm just grumpy 'cause I'm having a lot of issues with high speed gameplay encoding.  Like encoding stutters when swivelling the cam about. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Kinda wish #Elgato HD60 Pro was out when I was shopping for capture devices...  Mostly for the built in H.264 encoder my current one lacks. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Doing an unlisted test #livestream to make sure my capture device is going to cooperate for today's stream! https://t.co/xSSBRkn6wZ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GammaDX27 Xtro! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I hate deja vu's that leave feelings of dread.  Hope everyone's alright! <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @ClementJ64 yes!  I used to get Tips &amp; Tricks all the time!!!  Woo woo! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @pkmnrt That's okay, I never expect anyone to show up either, but that's how I met you.  :P  Hope it all went well! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @pkmnrt Aww, I missed it!  Dang it.  Glad it was successful though and you do lots more!!! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Also, tune in next Monday at 5 PM for more #Pokemon @YouTubeGaming.  Our adventure will continue this Canadian Thanksgiving!!! <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Breaking News:  Leftover #tacos are not nearly as tasty as fresh ones... #blegh <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ScarletDrkGames Oh goodness, that's cheap. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ScarletDrkGames I don't know.  But from the sounds of it I probably don't want to know. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ScarletDrkGames So...yes. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ScarletDrkGames It's this stuff.  Canadian Hunter Whisky:  http://t.co/twDu9zWuxe <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> So, I'm sitting here drinking #whisky and playing #Pokemon... I can't tell if I'm an 28 or 12! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Today bears a very special significance. This represents how I felt. ‘Meaghan's Song (Instrumental)’ on #SoundCloud https://t.co/Tt7NJ0drI2 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ScarletDrkGames And here's something I can drink to! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ScarletDrkGames Hooray!  I have have a small bit of whisky and vodka left.  Cheers! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ScarletDrkGames Damnit, you're making me thirsty.  And the liquor store is closed...  I wonder if I have anything kicking about... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Retweet in support of an amazing artist! https://t.co/kHeJHRW6Vs <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ScarletDrkGames That looks tasty.  Is it good? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> All clear now.  Sleep time. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Was having a good day.  Now I have stress and anxiety that won't be settled until later this morning... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> My #warlock's current item level is 666.  I think there should be a buff for that!  #Warcraft <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> So if you see Nihilus of Thrall US running, dats me!  #warcraft <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Well, gotta do my 5 DPS #timewalking #dungeons now. Not gonna be streaming those though, long queues don't make for good watchin'! #Warcraft <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Maybe I should just let the #Twitter #Warcraft community decide what I roll / where I roll it with my free 90 boost I have yet to use... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> This looks really cool with Mark of Blackrock's glow. [Sword of Unyielding Force] http://t.co/4thHPeVeUW #Warcraft <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Timewalking Weekend Event - Burning Crusade - Tanking: http://t.co/NUTflALmZB via @YouTube <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Thank you so much #Blizzard for the #Timewalking events.  I can't wait to see what you guys do with them in future!  #warcraft #love <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Da Nibs!  Niblick and Niblette!  All awesome.  #Warcraft http://t.co/gifuaFGtKs <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Oh dear, #timewalking items don't look as nice on Niblick as on Niblette. Like in #BurningCrusade he's looking clownish!  #Warcraft <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> While we wait for today's #video to go up, check out last night's #archived #livestream! https://t.co/Bzyh6cP5wO via @YouTube #warcraft <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Live Stream hath ended. The #dungeons have been #tanked and the #quest completed.  Catch the repeat archived on @Youtube soon! #warcraft <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> #tanking #timewalking #live now @Twitch.  Join Niblick on Thrall US!  http://t.co/Yni33QmKJd #warcraft <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Sometimes dying is worth the view from the floor.  #Warcraft. http://t.co/m7rdpiUcyM <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Just gonna stream my random faffing about in #warcraft on @Twitch right now over at http://t.co/Yni33QmKJd.  Nothing special. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm going to go #heal a couple #timewalker #instances. If anyone needs a #healer let me know! I'll be on Niblette - US Thrall. #warcraft <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I have the #Brewfest music stuck in my head.  #warcraft <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ScarletDrkGames Well, that's probably 'cause you know bears inside and out!  That's why I always use you as my benchmark bear reference! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ScarletDrkGames and it seems like more often than not it's the latter... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ScarletDrkGames It's always a roll of the dice when I see a bear in a group.  They're usually fantastic or super poop.  Not many inbetween. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ScarletDrkGames I have much to learn about their ways.  All I know is they're super rad no matter how you slice 'em. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ScarletDrkGames Rude!  It's not our fault bears can spam self heals and roll hots all day long!!! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ScarletDrkGames Yes.  But this time it was a comment about the bear from my live stream outhealing me. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> #Druids are OP...but awesome!  #Warcraft <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> If you give it a few minutes to finish processing it'll have full 1080p 60 fps quality, but you can start watching right away if you'd like! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Miss the stream earlier?  Here it is!  #Timewalking Weekend Stream - Burning Crusade https://t.co/Bzyh6cP5wO via @YouTube #warcraft <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I want to know: what's YOUR favourite class role? Are you a #tank at heart, or caring #healer? Or do you prefer savage #DPS?  #warcraft <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Uggh, da #tacos (or #chocolatemilk) gave me a #tummyache.  :( <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Only a few days to go until the next #Pokemon #LeafGreen #LiveStream @YouTubeGaming! Hope to see everyone there! https://t.co/3aEwb2Lfn5 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Aaaand, #tacos again, after their computer finally decided to pop my order up...  #notimpressed #yotaco <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Nevermind, no #tacos...their online ordering thing buggered up and never sent my order in...now they aren't delivering.  #fml  #hungry <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> #TACOS!!!!! <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Fixin' shit... &gt;&lt; <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> First up, I'll be healing on Niblette of US Thrall.  So whisper me in game if you'd like a healer for some Timewalking dungeons!  #warcraft <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Just an impromptu stream of some Timewalking.  Wanna party?  Whisper Niblette on US Thrall. https://t.co/jl6bYpsGGd via @YouTube #warcraft <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Well, it's not really new, I mean I made it in 2009, but I uploaded it now, so there! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> My new sounds: 40 Winks https://t.co/Yb2Hf4yXQ2 on #SoundCloud <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Yay!  Weekend!  That means plenty of time for #Timewalking and #livestreaming.  Maybe even both at the same time!!!  #cheers #warcraft <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I kinda wish #timewalking Shadow Labs was a thing.  #warcraft <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Okay, that's enough Niblette for now.  :)  Good times.  #warcraft <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> This is absolutely glorious looking!  I love it to death. [Mazthoril Honor Shield] http://t.co/kEwTXKLDaD #Warcraft <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @ScarletDrkGames @Alreesa92 that is amazing!  And adorable!  Amazing artist. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Aw man!  Waking up is such garbage when it ends an awesome dream...  #groggy #grumpy <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Sorry for the intermittent live stream to anyone who attempted watching over the last 6 hoursish or however long it's been.  #OBS hates me. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> My #OBS keeps crashing. :( <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Anyone wanna watch me struggle to learn how to play songs?  Tune in live here!  http://t.co/CvOupBquIW  #BeGentle <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Well, so far i'm doing better than yesterday, anyhow.  #hooray <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Alright.  Here's to hoping today is better than the last.  Yesterday sucked for so many reasons...  #hope <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Bleh, why do people like chicken soup?  Why can't a thick beef stew with big potato chunks and stuff be the better choice for the ill? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Heh, oh @amazon .  I first read that ad as "Kindle Paperweight."  Probably not a good thing. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Being in bed all day isn't as fun as I had hoped.  I'm not hungry, but I know I need to eat something.  :( <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @SindelPellion Only the nice ones. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> #Fishing and a big #rant about #equality of #genders and stuff on today's episode.  Enjoy!  https://t.co/pE45UKl5Mc via @YouTube <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I really like #Holy #Paladin, at least in the Proving Grounds.  It's a lot more active than #druid, that's for sure. #warcraft. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I just earned the [Proving Yourself: Gold Healer] Achievement! #Warcraft  YATTA!!! http://t.co/Yzj8eoDZIZ <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @ScarletDrkGames at least i got half the hours in.  Home stuff and many trips to the loo hooooo! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KhapriceHeska aww, thanks! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ScarletDrkGames thank you.  This bumpy bus is not helping though.  Lol <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I don't like these marks on my record, but I had to leave work early for the 2nd time ever.  #ill #bummed <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Uggh, i feel like #butt today... <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> I just earned the [Proving Yourself: Silver Healer] Achievement! #Warcraft.  One try?  Why did #Bronze take so long? http://t.co/5lTLbzBaaQ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Sweet zombie Jesus, #Bronze was an ordeal.  I was almost #oom.  I'm clearly not good at #Holy #Paladin.  Workin' on it though. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Oof, this #Holy gearset is godawful.  But it's a starting point, I guess... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Uggh, I dun goofed...  I just wanted to take an afternoon nap, not a full night's sleep!  Gaaaaaaaah!  My sleep schedule! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @bnewman126 Was watching a few #LetsPlay of it from the likes of @markiplier and @Jack_Septic_Eye.  Looks both awesome and hilarious. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I just earned the [Level 100] Achievement! #Warcraft.  Now to learn how to Holy Pally...  I'm sorry future groups!!! http://t.co/Is1iwO3mQ9 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I kinda wish I had a PS4 so I could try Until Dawn for myself.  That shit looks so awesome! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Now #rain, you promise to cool things down here and NOT just make everything stupidly #humid tomorrow?  I'ma trust you now, don't disappoint <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I wish I actually liked eggs and bought them regularly so that I could use the cartons to soundproof my apartment...  Oh well... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Although sometimes the words come naturally with the right motivation. #SoundCloud? #np https://t.co/gIRDtA4kCb <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Thinking about #writing #lyrics for some of my older #tunes and stuff.  Hard to put words to things that never really needed them though... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I don't just do Let's Plays.  Sometimes I also do music stuff.  With terribad vocals, even!  #SoundCloud. #np https://t.co/HdWdMAvtqQ <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Thanks everyone who came out to watch the #Warlock #Timewalking #livestream @twitch.  Until next time, my friends!!! <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> So, turns out #timewalking actually ends for me on the 8th, so i was wrong in my earlier live stream.  I'll #warlock tomorrow after all! <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @SindelPellion @MaxSingularity What's with the xmas stuff?  It's not even Thanksgiving yet!  (And then Halloween...and then 'Murican T-Day.) <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Good lord, I didn't even realize I had my inventory open for so long... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Small warning, @YouTube is taking a long time to process the #timewalking video to it's highest quality because it is so long.  Soon though. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Well, that took all day, but it's finally up!  Yay! <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Only a little longer until it is permanent and i can finally live on a (mostly) normal schedule!  #excited #hadagreatday <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Time to go download #Handbrake... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> My own fault for not checking the recording format in #OBS before I got started though...  Next time it'll be #MP4 like it usually is!!! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> For real #Adobe?  You can't import #FLV videos?  THEY'RE YOUR OWN FORMAT!!!  Looks like this live stream goes up as is or I'ma have to work. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Dem hips!  Wow! https://t.co/MIEDSmtxkN <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I have a #problem folks.  I am both #hungry and have the urge to #nap. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Big thanks to @ScarletDrkGames for joining me on that live stream.  It'll probably be up on @YouTube whenever I get around to it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'll be on Niblick on #Thrall for now so if anyone wants to party up drop me a line!  Probably won't be the most responsive here for a bit. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Alright folks, should be live now at http://t.co/CvOupBquIW.  Let's go enjoy some #timewalking. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Alright, time to set up #OBS.  Just have to decide if I wanna live stream or make higher quality vids for @YouTube .  #timewalking <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> "Morning," Twitter. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Can still #tank on my #Paladin, #DPS on my #Warlock, and #heal on my #Druid at least.  Nice to know I haven't lost my touch entirely... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Welp...  Time for a name change... http://t.co/inTvoOr56r <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ScarletDrkGames You know, I can't say I ever actually used one that I remember. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ScarletDrkGames These are addictive, just had a few back to back.  I'll probably do it tomorrow when I get unlazy and set up the stuff. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Tempted to maybe #stream these #timewalker runs and stuff sometime.  Could be fun / embarrassing! <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @ScarletDrkGames But man, so cool!!!  I'm down with this, 100%! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ScarletDrkGames I warlocked it to scope it out.  I haven't played in almost a year, I didn't wanna subject anyone to that kinda torture. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Wow, I could probably tank these.  This will be a lot of fun! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Nuts to this, I'ma go kill dinos until this queue pops. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Looks like this is about as good as it gets as far as capturing from my #Genesis is gonna go.  Bottom bar 4 lyfe? http://t.co/tMoacfxshs <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I should have sprung for a Framemeister.  This cheap Chinese thing can't output 4:3 which adds needless toil to my capturing... #sigh <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Grumble grumble!  Genesis looks great on TV and Monitor, but the Capture Card is not being friendly for some reason.  I am not amused... <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> So much for spring…it's snowing again! <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> I don't get why so many people think Flying Battery Zone in Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles is the Duracell kind of battery.  It a weapons battery... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Damn, I think I might need some new shoes soon.  These nearly 3 year old puppies have seen better days... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> For those looking for a quick and easy software solution for their 2012 taxes, TaxTron 2012 is what I used.  Works for both Mac and Windows. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> 2012 taxes done.  Pain in the butt. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> The bulk of two songs are done.  Hooray! <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Interesting... http://t.co/X3ZJUPf2 <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Welcome to NBA JAM! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Fine winter, you win… I'm sorry… <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The ambient temperature in my apartment right now is somewhere between 15 and 17 degrees celsius.  Personally, I think that is too cold... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Cat Lady! http://t.co/MRYJVAlQ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> -15?  Is that the best you can do!? <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> I've got so much dog fur on my clothes right now that if I went outside I'd probably get attacked by hippies. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> That and nobody else has really given accessibility options a second thought.  Just saying'... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Which smartphone operating system do I prefer?  iOS.  Windows 8 sucks balls, Android is okay.  But, personally: I like less screen clutter. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Perogies for lunch?  How delightful! <Text_End>

https://t.co/BB4qVbbV! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The thing about The Snowmen in Doctor Who: I don't think British people understand how to properly make one... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I don't GT or ski anymore like I did in my younger years, so: Winter, although you have been great, I think we need to break up… <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Here is the soundtrack from the game I just recently finished.  It is lovely.  Enjoy!  http://t.co/GmE98kPj <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Fun fact: 93% of every human that has ever lived is DEAD! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> That ending...  One of the best i've ever seen...  Bravo!!! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> For the record:  i don't like most 3rd person shooters.  Uncharted is one of the only exceptions. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Chapter 26...let's do this... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> God damn I love the Uncharted series.  The stories are great, the characters are well developed, and the adventure is epic.  A must play! <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Freezing my nips off here... <Text_End>
