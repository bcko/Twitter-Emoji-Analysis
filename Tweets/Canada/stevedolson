<Text_Begin> @rookienotes Somebody had to say it. I hoped that it was @kanyewest himself, but I guess I had to do it! <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @amywhiggins It's great, you can go up to an ebook with smaller blog posts, or splitting an ebook down to different posts, it's great :) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> A5: Don't think so! Ppl might be tired of clicking 2 different headlines towards the same blog post, but that's a small % #CMWorld <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Wish I knew HOW they were repurposing content w/ more examples of the different ways you can rework content for different mediums. #CMWorld <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> A3: Coming up w/ different titles, reworking the content to make it visual (inforgraphic, photo quotes) for different platforms #CMWorld <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> A2: If your goal is to make a white paper or ebook, then starting small works well. But big content can be shared more easily! #CMWorld <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> A1: Summarize! Gives the reader more of an idea and background information of what they are about to click! #CMWorld <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @markcorbett In Canada they don't have postal codes, but if you know where your buyers might be from zip codes would be a good way to target <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @markcorbett Yup! But each project is different. You really have to experiment with wording, visuals and demographics to find a sweet spot. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @markcorbett Try a low budget, $5 a day and if it's working, up the budget. If not, try another image or demographic targeting w/ your ads! <Text_End>
