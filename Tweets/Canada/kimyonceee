<Text_Begin> They put all their attention into iPhone apps because it's easier. The developers don't wanna put in the extra effort Android requires. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Android is a much more complex system because it's designed to work on multiple different devices. App developers are lazy though. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Kris should not be encouraging her daughter to bring her gross boyfriend anywhere. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Thank god for Kendall. She's the only one who really calls out Kylie's bs. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Lmfao the kids in the background. They're so cute! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> YAS finally we get to see them drag Kylie for bringing Tyga on the girls vacation. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Kylie is rude af to Kendall. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I would be piiiiissed if my mom was talking to my ex. Especially after all Khloe went through. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Whenever twitter asks me why I'm closing an ad on my timeline I always say it's offensive. I'm offended that this bs is on my tl. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I have no time to waste getting shit faced. I'm always either working or at school. I've got real goals and partying doesn't fit into them. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Like idgaf if you've met Kim, doesn't mean you get to be an asshole. Be a nice person and stop acting better than everyone. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Like some of you let being one of Kim's "faves" get to your head and it's annoying as fuck. Like you know we all pretend to like you right? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> If you're a part of this fandom and you think you're an elite fan cause Kim invited you to her brunch, please deflate your big ass head. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @scottkardashx wow really?! I read about that last year and it sounded horrific. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> RT @MyleezaKardash: You can tell Kim was super hands on with them because they mirror her and her personality so well! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Ray J gave that tape to Vivid to ruin Kim's life. Kim had no ability to stand up to Vivid, who insisted they obtained the the legally. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @adoringwests @KimKardashian so it's only apple? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> People do not realize that Kim's tape was a major violation of her privacy. She did the only thing she could and took the money from it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Or when building a business empire out of a sexual violation gives you 38M followers and emojis. https://t.co/ZOYVTe2sAy <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> If nobody wants those pictures, the paparazzi won't take them. I respect publications that have banned pap pics of celebrity children. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> If you want North &amp; Saint to have more privacy stop reposting the images and clicking on the articles from the tabloids. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KutieNameKim it will never be enough. They'll keep following them forever as long as you're clicking on the articles and sharing the pics <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Y'all really don't understand how this whole paparazzi thing works. If there were no demand for these pics, there would be no supply. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The irony of complaining about the paparazzi following Kim &amp; Kanye's kids and then posting the photos everywhere 😒 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KutieNameKim yeah but they won't because people flock to those articles, fans included... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Kim &amp; Kanye should be able to take their children to a doctors appointment without being stalked by the paparazzi. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Like clearly some creep with a telephoto lens followed them and hid while snapping those pics. That makes me uncomfortable. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Not posting any of the pics of the fam going to Saint's doctors appointment. They're creepy as fuck in my opinion. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @MyLifeIsKimK agreed. She's a different person than she was when she first had Nori. Being a mom changed her so much. In the best way. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Kim's got the hang of the whole mom thing so she doesn't need to take as much time off as she did the first time around. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm surprised that Kim has been so active already. I think it's probably a little easier this time around cause she's not first time mom. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @Khlomoney98 oh I agree. I don't see any issue with reposting the free content. Just the paid content should be left alone. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Khlomoney98 I highly doubt that the media pays to subscribe to their apps. Either way, how is it any different than when fans share? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MyLifeIsKimK @Khlomoney98 no they don't, if you want to see the content then you should subscribe. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The media only posts content from the girls' apps because the fans do. The media isn't actually subscribed to their apps 😂 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Khlomoney98 then we as fans should stop sharing the content because they're getting it from us... <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @JBeyBlueCarter Meek and Chris are very different situations. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> If you support Chris Brown, please don't talk to me. I have no respect for anyone who supports a disgusting man like him. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Y'all buying his album are the reason he's still famous. Nobody takes domestic violence committed by celebrities seriously. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> We all saw those pictures of Rihanna. I hope they flash in your head when you go to buy Chris Brown's new album <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Chris Brown shouldn't still be famous. He is a disgusting man. No amount of attempted redeption makes up for what he did. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Charlie Sheen abused his wives and people some how still had sympathy for him when he revealed he was HIV positive. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Like Sean Penn tied Madonna to a chair and beat the shit out of her, but people still think he's a good actor. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The fact that Chris Brown still has a career disgusts me. The way famous spousal abusers are treated is disgraceful. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> I need a roomba. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> And it's always directed by that same guy. It's like he made one good movie with them and decided that he would just keep doing that. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Is anyone else soooo bored of movies with Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper? Every 6 months they have a new one out. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Seriously though, @KimKardashian is so fierce when it comes to protecting her sisters. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> .@KimKardashian is ride or die for her sisters. She's so protective of Khloe. She really wants her sister to be happy. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KutieNameKim lol they just never mention provinces when they talk about Canada on TV in the states so I wonder if people know them <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KutieNameKim yas! Quebec!!! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Quick, how many of my American friends know which province Montreal is in??? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Yas! So glad to have you to talk to! https://t.co/M5F4JLMhcV <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> OMG COREY NO. You just don't say things like that. Like we get it, you and Kris are having sex. Stop saying it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @NailahShy: This is me OMG hahaha. If someone did this omg i come back with 10 folds https://t.co/hmpOaKx5yL <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm not sure why people are surprised that jungle cats are sweet. They're literally giant cats. They're docile until you fuck with them. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> This old crone just keeps using the Kardashian-Jenner name for attention cause nobody cares about his crusty ass. https://t.co/XfYEvhkYik <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Ommmmmmmmg lion cubssssssss <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It's because Corey tries to act like a dad. It's weird. No bro. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I always said that Kylie was the girl who would bring her boyfriend to a girls night or in this case a girls trip. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Baby Reignnnnnn. He's so freaking cute!! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Maybe I just find it weird that Corey is the same age Kim but dating Kris. I mean go Kris but it's just weird when he's around the fam. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Jonathan is so right about Kylie though... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Corey is just weird imo. Idk his presence is bizzare to me. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> My mom just asked me if it would be awkward to go to my Aunt's house for xmas eve because her nephew hit on me at my cousins wedding 😂 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I s2g @KimKardashian looks so pretty in this scene! She's also so hilarious 😂 #KUWTK <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Lmfao could you imagine Kris Jenner pregnant at 60 😂😂😂😂 #KUWTK <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KimKardashian I am!!!!! So excited! You look so pretty! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Lol I was watching KUWTK with my mom and she saw Kendall and Kylie and said "Clearly the big ass gene comes from Kris" 😂😂😂 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TvBashers that's just so disgraceful. Like idgaf if you dont like your ex, that's the mother of your child, you owe her respect. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Yet somehow y'all like Bieber but hate Taylor. What's up with that? Says something about you as a person imo. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Taylor didn't even drink until she turned 21. Bieber had a DUI before he even turned 21. Taylor is nice and Bieber is a giant brat. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Taylor bakes cookies for her fans and throws them parties. Bieber will walk off stage at the slightest provocation. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I find it really funny that some of y'all hate Taylor Swift but like Justin Bieber. Like how does that make any sense? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Like remember Mason's Nightmare Before Christmas party!? That was amazing!!! <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @TvBashers LMFAO he probably is 😂😂😂😂 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TvBashers me neither. I don't think he actually bought anything for Nicki though, I think she paid for it. He doesn't have thst kind of $$$ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Just know that if y'all hate on Taylor, we're not really friends. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Y'all should watch on December 20th. The show is so much fun! I danced for like 4 straight hours! https://t.co/dzuM9l8Hf7 <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @scottkardashx oh I didn't think you were I was just saying Kylie has work to do before getting a Vogue cover <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @scottkardashx a spread is one thing, a cover is another. Kim worked for years to get hers, I can't imagine Kylie just being handed a cover. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> You mean Nicki bought herself expensive rings and pretended that Meek gave them to her?? https://t.co/VhaCd0vo41 <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @FlwlssKardash @scottkardashx no problem at all doll! I just made a guess about the meaning and it turned out to be right 😂 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kim_kanye_ send him a picture of urban decay's naked pallete 😂 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Kim and Kanye gave their children unique names that have a very special meaning to them. Nobody cares if you think the names are stupid. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Saint was given his name because he's their blessing. Kim was told she might never be able to be pregnant again. So he was a miracle! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> North got her name because she's Kim and Kanye's north star. They saw her as the highest point in their relationship. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> My mom was saying that North &amp; Saint were dumb names but when I told her the real meaning behind both names she was like awwww that's cute. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @scottkardashx it made sense when you really thought about it. They had such a hard time conceiving him! <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> OK I'm sorry how do y'all still have respect for Nicki!? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @gabsfeeds cause she usually takes about 2-3 months off after having a baby. She did with North so I'm guessing she will with Saint. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Ew keep Nicki off my timeline please 😒 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I miss Kim so much you guys. It's only been 3 days. How are we going to survive until February!? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Nicki will probably pay off the courts to protect her scumbag rapist brother... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @_Nita_maraj_ did you need to see it happen for you to believe it?! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @_Nita_maraj_ the police do not arrest a man for rape without evidence, but that's not enough for y'all. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> No 12 year old lies about being sexually assaulted. That does not happen. If you don't believe a kid, you need to get off this planet. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Yes because the police arrest people for rape without evidence....... 😒 these Nicki fans are so disgusting. https://t.co/fn954c6weG <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @_Nita_maraj_ you're literally accusing a victim of lying. How disgusting are you!? She's fucking 12. Get out of my mentions you pig. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @_Nita_maraj_ if she was actually a good person she would have left his ass to rot. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @_Nita_maraj_ yes it does. I'd never bail my family member out of jail if they raped a child. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Like you're not accused of assaulting a child for no reason. If you're being arrested for it, it means they have evidence.... 😒 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Nicki fans are so disgusting. Trying to insinuate a child is lying about a grown man assaulting her. That's so sick. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> You can bet your ass that my sister would be rotting in jail if she was accused of raping a fucking child. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Yes. Because no child accuses a grown man of rape for no reason. I actually choose to believe victims....  https://t.co/7ZFTEYJ7lT <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @_Nita_maraj_ no 12 year old accuses a man of rape if it didn't happen. You're disgusting defending a rapist. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @_Nita_maraj_ your fave is disgusting. Her brother raped a 12 year old and she still supports his disgusting ass. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @_Nita_maraj_ ok well good for her then. She's still scum for bailing her disgusting rapist brother out of jail <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Nicki Minaj better never call herself a feminist ever again. Feminists don't bail child rapists out of jail. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KimKendallKy not at all. He murdered that woman and is now basically walking away from it. That's so sick. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> If you're still a Nicki Minaj fan after she bailed her child rapist brother out of jail then I have absolutely no respect for you... <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Y'all have no legitimate reasons to hate Taylor Swift. Y'all are just mad that Kanye's actions towards her caused him problems.... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Also people only like Where Are You Now because of the beat. So you can give the credit to Skrillex &amp; Diplo. Bieber just whined on the track <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> How the fuck did Bieber score a Grammy nom?! It will be his first and only nom. No way is he gonna win 😂 <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Taylor Swift threw parties for her fans at every one of her homes across the country, when will you fave ever??? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Taylor Swift has been the most charitable celebrity for the last 3 years, when will your fave ever? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> People who hate on Taylor Swift are far too bitter. Her music is fun, she's incredibly kind, and no one treats their fans the way she does. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Badguyz01 nah women like me don't go anywhere near men who need to ditch their 50 hoes in order to be loyal 😂😂😂😂 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Badguyz01 lmfaaaaaaooooo you're so missing the point here 😂😂😂😂😂 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Can't wait for 1989 to win AOTY! Loved how Taylor switched up her sound and the tour was so much fun! <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @Badguyz01 us women who are classy want nothing to do with a man who has a bunch of hoes around him.... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Badguyz01 ok but you can't have the hoes and then whine about why you don't have an Ayesha. Having the hoes around is why... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Because her album wasn't released during the 2015 eligibility period.... https://t.co/QlTLhkyoNQ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> A prime example of how ridiculous y'all are. Whining about wanting an Ayesha but seeking out hoes to satisfy you 😂 https://t.co/2T2UehS4tK <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Badguyz01 then why are y'all whining about wanting a woman like Ayesha? If your gonna be using hoes to feed your ego 😒 <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Y'all are like "we're not like that, you're stereotyping" if that's true then why do I have a bunch of women in my mentions agreeing? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm not here for the men that have 20 different female "friends" that they casually flirt with to feed their egos. Either commit or fuck off <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Men get so pressed when you call them on their bullshit behavior. None of y'all are knights in shining armour. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Plowden1 @ChapmanIvey nobody is lying here, y'all are like that 😂 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ChapmanIvey y'all wanna have 50 hoes on hand to feed your egos instead of finding yourselves a good woman. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ChapmanIvey nobody is saying that, you have to be a man who respects your woman and treats her well, y'all don't do that shut. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Unfollow all those twitter hoes and talk to one girl and then maybe you'll find an Ayesha. Until then, stop whining. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KimKendallKy I'm thinking she's getting to that point. She's seemed very distant from him since they got back together. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Women like Ayesha Curry have no time for most of you because y'all can't commit to one woman even if you had a gun to your heads 😂 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Meaning don't have 500 insta &amp; twitter hoes that you talk to on a daily basis. Don't be flirting with 50 different women all the damn time. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Gonna say this to all the men on twitter:
If you want a woman like Ayesha Curry, then you need to be a man like Steph. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KimKendallKy lol I did cause she never goes anywhere without him so it was surprising that he didn't follow her to Miami 😂 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KimKendallKy Kylie is all about Kylie these days. Did you notice she went to Miami without Tyga though!? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The men on here want to masturbate to these insta hoes and then they want to trash those women for doing what they enjoy. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Like seriously dudes are on here trashing women for not being more like Ayesha, then 2 tweets later they post a naked woman. Y'all are ridic <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KimKendallKy she's too busy partying with Trashy Baldwin and her friends. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Like I said early. No issue with Ayesha but issue with the dicks on twitter begging for an Ayesha, while chatting up insta hoes daily... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I think it came off as her trying to shame the choices of other women, but all Ayesha was saying is that style doesn't work for her. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> 100% think twitter overreacted to what Ayesha Curry said. She just said she's into keeping the goods for her hubby, nothing wrong there. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @NailahShy I'm always wary of mentors cause my last one got me fired from my job... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I get why Ayesha said what she said. She's a church girl who married her teenage sweetheart. Of course she prefers to be modest. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Men say they want women to be more respectable and to that I say, you first... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> We're out there guys... Y'all are just too busy flirting with 20 different chicks on twitter to actually treat a woman right... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Y'all want an Ayesha Curry but you don't realize that you have to be a respectable man with ambition and loyalty to get a girl like her... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Men in this day and age are ridiculous. They want their women to be everything while all they do is wear sweatpants &amp; play Xbox.... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> To all the men who want us to be more like Ayesha Curry, why don't you unfollow all your insta hoes and wife someone up?! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NailahShy right!?! It's infuriating. These men have no respect for women, then whine that women aren't respectable. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NailahShy it's just nonsense, these men are like Ayesha is right, then they're following 50 insta hoes and refuse to commit. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Don't be telling women to be like Ayesha Curry when you're not going to treat her like Steph treats Ayesha... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Men want a respectable woman but they don't want to respect women, like okay.... <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> I always love it when the people who leave nasty comments on the Internet have some bible quote or something about faith in their bio 😂 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ToyEtoille @eonline have fun being a rude beyotch. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ToyEtoille @eonline like any regular woman does.... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ToyEtoille @eonline she's not bitching and moaning, she's talking about the difficulties she's experienced in her pregnancy <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Like who the hell actually thinks that pregnancy is magic sunshine that's 100% comfortable?! Every woman will be uncomfortable at some point <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The haters act like Kim expressing her discomfort is her thinking she's the only woman who has ever experienced that, it's ridiculous. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The comments on this tweet are ridiculous. Saying she should suck it up, calling her a princess. https://t.co/hEzYBOBxWh <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AndreiaNoel lmfao yuuup! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ToyEtoille @eonline so she's never allowed to express her discomfort? She's the only pregnant woman around who can't be uncomfortable?! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Aww I just realized that they get to have Christmas with the baby!!! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KimKendallKy right?! It felt like she was gone for so long 😣😣 I <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Gotta love how Kylie is too busy partying and taking pictures of herself to congratulate her sister publicly... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NailahShy oh yeah I like that better <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I miss Kim already 😣😩 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NailahShy Walt Omari West sounds perfect! And Walt is so unique. North &amp; Walt. I can see it. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> So Kanye literally just had a baby. He's tending to his wife, daughter, and son and you're all asking about his album 😒 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Kimblagh I know right?! You have to be a next level asshole to steal a baby's birth certificate. Glad the bitch got fired. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Kimblagh yeah hopefully no snake nurses steal the birth certificate like th ey did with North <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Kimblagh I hope they release the name soon and shut those morons and the ones saying it should be Wild up <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> They're not going to use another direction. It would make North's name less special. They have something else in mind. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Kimblagh the tabs just made up Easton cause she mentioned it like once. They would never use another direction. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @IAmLebaron they'll believe anything the tabloids tell them. The Easton idiots are better than ones saying the name should be Wild 😑 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Working in a pharmacy is hard but I'm loving the challenge. So much to learn and know. Glad I got this opportunity <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I only have an hour and half left in my 8 hour shift and I just ate for the first time since 10:30 this morning. Crazy day! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @IAmLebaron exactly. It's not what we expect ever, there's no point in guessing until she announces it herself. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Guys until Kim herself makes a post on her app with his name, nothing is official. Just cause the tabs say Easton doesn't mean it's true. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KimKendallKy because everything Kim and Kanye do is a joke to these idiots. Even their son who isn't even a day old yet. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @itsKELSEYtho I know! I'm a little freaked out. I'm not even kidding when I said I saw thst date for months. Legit buying a lottery ticket <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> What should they name Baby Boy West <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Omg they should name him Walt West since he shares the day with Disney! I still want Omari but Walt would be fun too! <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @itsKELSEYtho I really reaaaally want them to name him after Kanye. Kanye is the kind of man who needs a son with his name. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Like North is an iconic name and if they just keep going with direction names it's sounds kind of goofy. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I don't want Easton just cause it makes North's name less special imo. Makes it kind of cheesy. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> My vote is for Omari or Kanye West II <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Idk I just threw Robert on there for funsies. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @itsKELSEYtho and the idiots have no idea they've been blocked 😂 <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Bootstrap = 💥💥💥💥 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AndreiaNoel I completely agree. She totally changed how she acted publicly after that which I get. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AndreiaNoel he probably does his best to reassure her but that 8 months of abuse she took in 2013 took a major toll on her. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'd actually watch a Bond movie if this happened. https://t.co/RC6NmdhHK8 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KimKendallKy it's already bad enough that it's gonna be all in 1 month! Baby West needs his own birthday. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> They trash Kim for wanting to be skinny again, but at the same time they call her a hippo. Our society is disgusting. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Do you ever just want to cry when you think about Kim hating her body? That's all because of how cruel people were during her 1st pregnancy. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KimKardashian everyone's body is built differently. Your curves are your signature, baby just added to the curves ❤ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KimKardashian I'm so sorry you're struggling with your body. Take your time and don't push yourself. You'll be back to your old self soon! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Is anyone else hoping that Kim doesn't give birth on the 14th? It would suck for Mason, Reign, &amp; Ye Jr. to all have the same birthday. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> It was obvious the email wasn't actually read, I was simply given a copy and pasted response about the livestream not working. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @missodessa I do photoshopping for a living and there is no evidence of the kind of photoshop you're talking about soooo.... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KimKardashian please get your developers to give your Android version the same attention they give to the iPhone version!!! <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @AndreiaNoel I will do that. Thanks doll! <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Did anyone else with an Android phone get to see that stream?! Has your app updated?! Is it just my phone?! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I subscribed for the livestreams, I love the content but those streams are what I paid for. If I'm not gonna get them then why bother? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It's not Kim's fault her developers are stupid or lazy or whatever, so not blaming her. But this is just bad business.. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> This legit bothers me. I'm not going to pay money for an app the developers don't even bother to update. Like what nonsense. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KimKardashian ok but what about Android users Kim?! We got no update and no livestream..... <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @KimKardashian the livestream is not working for android users as there has been no update to the android version of the app. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KimKardashian but there's been no update to the android version! Why do your app developers hate android users?! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Dear lazy ass app developers, put as much energy into your android apps as you do your iPhone apps.... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> If they don't fix up the android version at the same time then it's not worth it for android users to subscribe... <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @itsKELSEYtho it's gonna be hard waiting on that picture 😣😣 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @itsKELSEYtho plus it gives him some time to chub up lol. Newborns can be kind of skeletal 😂 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @itsKELSEYtho that would be amazing but my guess is she'll wait until he's 3 months old like she did with North. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> But I'm also sad it's ending because pregnant Kimmy is adorable! And she slaaaayed pregnancy style this last year! <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> This girl just wants attention honestly. It's not about the wheelchair at all....  https://t.co/mqmueROaiz <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Should Kylie have said no to the wheelchair? Maybe but no teenage girl is going to want to stand up to a prominent photographer like that. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Kylie Jenner didn't decide to have that wheelchair in the shoot, the photographer did. She did what was being asked of her. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Kylie Jenner posted this a week ago, but y'all act like she's a heartless bitch for that one picture. https://t.co/PDgkwApWVx <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> But one picture where a photographer told her to sit in a wheelchair and people are saying she's making fun of disabilities like wtf?! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Kylie's "I Am More Than" series has called attention to societies cruelty towards people who are different or disabled. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KompletelyKfan she's clearly trying to highlight societies issue with things seen as different through her I Am More Than. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KompletelyKfan nah not at all. You're right. It's not Kylie's fault that society is shitty. Kylie actually really respects disabilities. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I hate crying in public but I'm not the kind of person who can stop once the upset starts. Bawling in class is so embarrassing. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KompletelyKfan yeah idk why people are so pissed. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I love how they blame her and not the photographer for planning the shot....  https://t.co/hLYv8aKqQ6 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @itsKELSEYtho thanks doll 😘 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm getting more hours and stuff but it's gonna take awhile for everything to balance out. I'm just so sick of things being like this. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Like I don't get paid for another week and half and I'm at -350. I haven't gotten out of my overdraft in 6 months. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NailahShy thanks love ❤ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm having such an emotional day. I want to cry so bad right now. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @howdoiknow1 oh totally. She gets major props for that. She knew that her lips were all people could talk about them so she turned it into $ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Stop acting like everything "breaks the internet" https://t.co/tshEnjJYM5 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @howdoiknow1 she just needs to figure herself out. She's clearly very unsure of herself at the moment. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NailahShy that's very true. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NailahShy makes sense. Next to Kendall she doesn't look great, but they're clearly doing different shit so the comparison is pointless. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @itsKELSEYtho @EkaterinaDrago omg this chick is crazy! All she does is stalk replies to Kim's tweets and talk shit. It's so sad. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NailahShy she's doing a decent job living up to the name. Especially after the success of her lip kit. That was a genius move for her. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Maybe I can't blame that on Apple, just on lazy developers, but still there's reasons why they pay more attention to their iPhone versions. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Because of it App developers give 10x the attention to iPhone apps than they do on any other platform it's annoying. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I legit hate Apple though. The way they create exclusivity with their products is frustrating as hell. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> There is no update available for Android phones..  https://t.co/IvBVCpx4e8 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NailahShy I'll agree there. Young stars do get a lot of pressure to be role models and she probably doesn't realize she doesn't have to. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Can I have boobs like this?! https://t.co/VgIfgi33HX <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NailahShy she doesn't HAVE to be a role model. Maybe people have her thinking she does have to, so that's why she says that stuff. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NailahShy I just think if she wants to be controversial, just do that. Own it. Ditch the role model crap and just go for it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NailahShy maybe I am just being a cranky beyotch. But at this point she's not someone I want my younger cousin to look up to. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @howdoiknow1 it just makes her look ridiculous. I know some think it's artistic but she was way too young for that kind of thing. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kimbalmain thanks doll! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NailahShy with wanting to be a role model in my opinion. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NailahShy she's doing better than most people her age that's for sure. Idk I feel like she lives for the controversy and that doesn't mix <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KutieNameKim that would be amazing though. I truly hope you're right! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KutieNameKim I'm not sure if she meant fans, I think she just meant some people are getting yeezy stuff for xmas in her family. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NailahShy I know she didn't choose this life but she's in it now and she needs to be a little smarter about the things she chooses to do. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NailahShy and these days they're learning a lot of toxic shit from her. If she wants to be a role model, she needs to act like one. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NailahShy she will learn but she does need to be more careful cause she has a bunch of kids following her example <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NailahShy lmfao buzz feed literally used your tweet <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NailahShy I don't think it's malicious either, I just think she needs to think a little more before she says things. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NailahShy or when she insists she wants to be a role model but then poses like a sex doll and dates a man too old for her. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NailahShy nah I'm talking about when reporters asked her about her lips and she kept saying she had nothing done. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NailahShy to lie about everything all the time. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NailahShy I get that she's not super confident but she's constantly lying and contradicting herself, sure she's young but she doesn't have <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> She must be too broke to hire a publicist to tell her to stop talking. Smh. https://t.co/OE06R1jlOy <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I would respect Kylie more if she would just be honest and just lean into the whole controversial thing. She's always lying and pretending. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Now Kylie is all, I wanna be a role model while posing as a sex doll... while dating a man too old for her, and having fake lips. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @_officialKhalil: That time of the semester: https://t.co/ZpChDfKMcg <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Kimblagh @yellliiikiss thank you for sharing this on my timeline. Most adorable thing I have seen in a long time <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Before she owned up to the fillers I mean. She pretended like they weren't there. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Kylie is the queen of contradicting herself. She says she hates makeup, yet wears a ton of it. She said she'd never had any work done too. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @KimKendallKy: the ending of this headline 🐸☕️ https://t.co/C0C5rqbSJZ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KimKendallKy I doubt she ever will. Her lips are her thing now. She uses them to market herself. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Am I the only one who thinks this relationship was totally fake? They conveniently broke up in time for her show.. https://t.co/EWOGtkFiUu <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Had the biggest crush on him in like 2004, now he looks sooooo weird. https://t.co/8jb8MtaoZO <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I was wrong about @chrissyteigen. She's definitely smarter than I thought. I underestimated her and I shouldn't have. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Stop. Is this for real 😑 https://t.co/YJd9W7JrdF <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Like this is why I love her. She's totally stepped into the mom role for Scott. https://t.co/DFvBSjw1UD <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Like that grocery store one they did where they had like fake Chanel products on the shelves. That was sick. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @scottkardashx omg I forgot about her horrible attempt at a TV show 😂😂😂 <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @KompletelyKfan @micnews my argument? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @DenolaGrey: Ok.. Let's not .. Lady Gaga had half of a music video in a glamorized wheel chair .. Sit down  https://t.co/rqzf9FEcBB <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I adore this look! https://t.co/N3AOz3ZWTK <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KimKardashian so happy about this! Have a safe delivery gorgeous! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Kylie Jenner sitting in a wheel chair doesn't make it harder for real wheelchair users to be taken seriously at all. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> When people joke about having social anxiety I get a little bothered, because they make it hard for me to be taken seriously. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Was it insensitive for me to sit in a wheelchair after getting surgery on my upper body? My legs were fine.. https://t.co/RmVaFhRhGG <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KimKendallKy @KKDASHDollKK she's not obligated to wear a single bit of makeup. She likes the way it looks despite what she says. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It makes them look petty and pathetic.  And no one wants to listen to anything they have to say because all they do is freak out... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> If the social justice community ever wants any real change to happen, they have got to stop losing it over the tiniest things. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Sooooooo she's supposed to be a sex doll?? https://t.co/ZyFaYd1CWK <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I bet you 90% of the people upset about Kylie Jenner sitting in a wheelchair have never had to use one themselves. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I thought it was shopped too but she's clearly sitting at a different angle in the second pic. https://t.co/Nu823BT11o <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> This is why nobody takes Internet social justice seriously. Cause y'all lose your shit over someone sitting in a wheelchair.... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> People are fucking ridiculous. It's a damn picture...  https://t.co/g29WzdaEpl <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @DarthVenn: Lady Gaga in a wheelchair or crutches for a music video = art
Kylie in a wheelchair for ONE pic for a shoot = romanticising … <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Was I appropriating that wheelchair? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Was me getting wheeled out of the hospital in a wheelchair abelist? I could walk just fine, but I had to use the chair anyway. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> People calling Kylie's shoot abelist is a prime example of social justice gone wrong. People are looking for anything to get upset about... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chrissyteigen that's a good choice, I also like Hefe and Inkwell for names 😂 <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Lol should I do a Kim advent calendar where every day I tweet a new picture of her with a Santa hat photoshopped on? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @KimKendallKy: "I hate wearing make-up"
But no one forced you to get lip fillers, a make up line, &amp; most importantly wear make up https:… <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KimKendallKy lmfao right!? If she hates it so much why does she put so much on?! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KimKanyeKimYe2 right?! Which is like impossible to do properly! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KimKanyeKimYe2 I love how she manages to look so epic and flawless just strolling by the sign. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @KimKanyeKimYe2: His #1 fan. #MrsWest https://t.co/gZqZ2yjnKi <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Kim &amp; Taylor Swift are the only celebs that truly care about their fans in my opinion. They go above and beyond. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KimKanyeKimYe2 agreed. She's so dedicated to us. I appreciate her putting in all that effort! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Oh wait you can't imagine that cause your crusty ass fave would never. Y'all are out here begging for tweets 😂 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Imagine your fave loving her fans so much that she's live tweeting with them shortly after having a procedure to turn her baby inside her. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KimKanyeKimYe2 omg I didn't even think about that! She loves her fans so much that she'll tweet with us after having a procedure like that! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @itsKELSEYtho yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaas tell him girl!!!! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @itsKELSEYtho LOOOOOIOIIIOOLLIOLO DOWNGRADED <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @itsKELSEYtho I know he likes her cause she's a doormat. He could fuck off for  a month like he did to me and she wouldn't say a word <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @itsKELSEYtho I got fired, dude tells me he's not ready for a relationship, then he started dating my "friend" it was insane. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @itsKELSEYtho right!? They're good with you as long as you're cute and fun but when something real happens it's like oh this is too much. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> What happened to the men who felt lucky to have a good woman in their life?! Who wanted to treat her as good as she treats him? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> They just want you around to fuck them, feed them, and clean up after their lazy asses. But you can't be emotional or opinionated ever. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> And the ones that do want commitment need their women to be docile with no opinions or ambition of her own. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Men would rather fuck around than actually have anything real in their lives cause they want sex but nothing else. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Every man between the age of 20-30 refuses to commit to a real relationship. They don't want to be "tied down" they wanna be slutty. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Honestly the issues with dating in this day and age stem from this generation of men being unwilling to commit. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> This! I s2g dating does not have to be this fucking hard. https://t.co/3YsrdhgzLO <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Also so glad that @KimKardashian has @kourtneykardash and her babies to be with North while Kimmy preps for North's brother to arrive. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Hopefully means she'll be able to deliver without the press knowing about it. Kim deserves some privacy after last time. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm also so glad to hear Kim was able to check into the hospital for a procedure without the tabloids finding out! <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @itsKELSEYtho yeah the more I look at it I think you're right. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @itsKELSEYtho photoshopped her a little too skinny imo <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @itsKELSEYtho I'm starting a decent collection of them lol <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @itsKELSEYtho yeah like that Tyler Oakley guy, or that Grace chick who E tried to help out. They're just annoying weirdos. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @itsKELSEYtho this is my fave Kim gif <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @itsKELSEYtho lol yuuuuuup and she'll get praise for it while they call Kim a ho. 😧 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Like remember when E tried to give that one girl from YouTube a show? And it was a complete mess and nobody watched it? <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @FutbolRobin yeah cause she's the most prolific business woman of our time 😊 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @FutbolRobin again because y'all are sheep and you'll file into stadiums to watch idiots run where they've been told. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> People give athletes way too much credit. I work for a professional sports team and those dudes are morons. They run where you tell them to. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @FutbolRobin y'all will pay lots of money to watch a really expensive version of gym class 😂 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @FutbolRobin just because a bunch of idiots assemble in stadiums to watch other idiots run around proves people are sheep. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @FutbolRobin she runs the development for her app &amp; game, has multiple clothing &amp; makeup lines, hair products etc. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Lol athletes are just idiots running up and down a field over and over again. Requires literally no brain power 😂 https://t.co/aVOv0EDsQA <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @FutbolRobin congrats you're interested in expensive gym class 😂😂😂😂 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @FutbolRobin because running multiple businesses isn't work and running back and forth across a field is? <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Kylie may have a break the internet moment at some point, but this was not it. It was an overwhelming success but the Internet didn't break. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The internet literally stopped what it was doing to talk about Kim's booty being on the cover of a magazine. It was everywhere. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The website for Kylie's Lip Kit crashing doesn't mean she broke the internet. It's exciting but it's not an iconic moment in pop culture. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @scottkardashx exactly. It's over a year old and it was one of the most popular Halloween costumes this year. Iconic. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KimKendallKy they're taking the term too literally is the problem. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It doesn't mean that a website cannot function properly due to traffic. It means the internet literally stops to talk about you for days. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The term Broke the Internet is more than just a website crashing. Kim had people talking for weeks about that cover. It was an iconic moment <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It was a once in a lifetime kind of thing. If a site crashes that doesn't mean it broke the internet...  https://t.co/mSB3RCFEX8 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> She just really needs to dump Tyga cause he's literally the only thing bringing her down. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> People love to hate Kylie the way they do with Kim and they're drawn to everything she does. She knows how to make money off their interest. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> She knows her lips get a lot of attention so she made a line of lip products. Genius. And it paid off big time! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> This Lip Kit thing is why I would totally love Kylie if it weren't for Tyga. She clearly has the family business sense. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I've got the most ridiculous people in my mentions today 😂 https://t.co/Z5ooAO2WLo <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @scottkardashx ok yeah I thought maybe the black one was, but the brown one was definitely real fur <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Kim K is a hoe when she poses nude but people are going to treat Amy Schumer like some magic goddess for being naked.... <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @scottkardashx aren't those both real fur? <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Like when she walked into the grad party and was like "omg this is so weird" I was like jfc Kylie be real for once... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The fake voice Kylie keeps using is soooooo damn annoying. Reminds me of the fake voice Kim used in the first few seasons. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @KimKendallKy oh thank you!!! I'm kind of sad I don't have the time to post anymore. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> She looks like a small baby version of the Queen. https://t.co/aMVCGhlmdy <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It was a popular ad though so I'm sure I can't be the only one who made a gif of it. It would just be cool if it was mine lol <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @KimKardashian @ORousteing fashion best friends forever! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KimKardashian because eating is awesome and so is KUWTK! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> .@KimKardashian has no time for your nonsense. She's too busy prepping for her baby and her bounce back! 🙌🙌🙌 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KimKardashian so happy you don't let this shit get you down. You're such a strong woman! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KimKardashian but being a mom totally is your thing! The pregnancy may be hard, but you're an amazing mom! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KimKendallKy agreed. They have a lot of classics under their belts, it's time to retire. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Everybody is all Selena wrote an album about her relationship with Justin, and they're mad about it. But he did the same thing.... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KimKendallKy me too but like even grown ups wasn't funny. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Bieber talks about Selena just as much as she talks about him, yet she takes the crap for it. Nobody ever asks him to stop. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KimKendallKy him and Adam Sandler just need to go away. Nothing they do is funny anymore. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Is he gonna stop talking about her?  https://t.co/VIkGC1Bb3e <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Idk why the haters don't just join Team Kardashian. They're as obsessed as we stans are. They just don't want to admit they like her. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KutieNameKim @KimKardashian because the haters are fans in disguise. They're so obsessed with her it's ridiculous. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @itsKELSEYtho it's hate for themselves though. They're angry about their lives so they want to tear her down. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I don't even care that @KimKardashian hasn't replied to me tonight. I just like knowing she's online and maybe sees my tweets 😊 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @itsKELSEYtho the person is clearly a troll based off their account. They tweet nonsense and rude shit at Kim. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Everyone who called @KimKardashian fat is going to have their jaw drop to the floor when she bounces back, you just wait... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> You're a beautiful pregnant goddess @KimKardashian! I hope you're feeling a bit better tonight! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KimKardashian @LuizJozeMonster lmfao I love it when you call these bitches out Kimmy! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @LuizJozeMonster @KimKardashian she's pregnant... she can eat whatever the fuck she wants... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @itsKELSEYtho @KimKardashian I'm serious though! Kim would be laughing forever if she met you cause you're just the funniest! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @itsKELSEYtho @KimKardashian you gotta meet Kelsey when you go back! She's the best and will have you laughing till you cry! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Exhausted from a long day at work but I'm staying up just to watch @KimKardashian on #KUWTK!!! Can't miss her beautiful face! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> LMFAO #whoreinadrawer https://t.co/07swR5xE7I <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KimKardashian @MyleezaKardash can't wait to see you two meet! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Focus by Ariana Grande is the worst song. Wtf I'd up with that chorus!? Weird dude screaming focus is so unpleasant. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KimKardashian leaving work! Be watching soon!!!!! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> If you hate Taylor Swift cause she shaded Katy Perry, you need a life. And better taste in music. Like who likes Katy Perry?! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MolestMeKardash I hope they actually are. UO is such a shady company. I'm sure Ye will sue their asses if they aren't lol <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MolestMeKardash oh yeah I forgot about that part! So it's Kris' house and some random desert road we need to find lol! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> And Taylor knows how much it means to fans when their fave sees their creations. So she keeps them. So sweet. Heart of gold. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Plus Taylor keeps every piece of fan art that's ever been given to her. Her mom says it's because Taylor used to give stuff to artists. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> And then you have last Christmas where Taylor sent like 20 giant boxes of gifts to a bunch of her fans. Like how sweet is that?! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Taylor is like the only celebrity who has invited fans to her home. She seeks people out at her shows to meet them. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'll never understand people who hate Taylor Swift. I don't mean her music, but her as a person. She's like the nicest person alive. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> My other fave is the sweetest! She's met more of her fans than any other celebrity. https://t.co/f2mN4xAuh3 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> You know all those graphic tees at Urban Outfitters are ripping off artists right? They steal designs and over charge for them... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MolestMeKardash but do the profits go to Kanye? UO likes to reproduce designs and sell them without crediting the original artist. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MolestMeKardash I'm guessing they shot the entire Vogue spread there. Now that I think back on the pics it was all over Kris' house! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Thank god for DVR! Without it I'd miss the first 20 minutes of #KUWTK cause I work until 7! Can't miss @KimKardashian &amp; @kourtneykardash! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Does she even have a career anymore?! I thought we killed it already. https://t.co/rKdVxoIeFB <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MolestMeKardash @KimKardashian you're the best!!! <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @itsKELSEYtho I so want to! Gotta see the sights!!! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @harleyrobyn @eonline so glad someone else feels this way. His daughter &amp; his father are suing and it's ridiculous. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Beyonce desperately needs a new stylist. She does good on the carpet but her street style is a mess. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @itsKELSEYtho come up anytime and I'll show you the sights! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @itsKELSEYtho @KompletelyKfan they look like expensively dressed hobos all the time <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @itsKELSEYtho lol come visit me in Canada. I'll show you the snow. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Kimblagh the actual pieces she wears aren't horrible but the fabrics always are. It's a disaster. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I hope it's not either/or cause they both belong on this list.  https://t.co/Zdr0BEjifX <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @itsKELSEYtho yeah I hate the snow but I couldn't imagine Christmas without it! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @itsKELSEYtho @KompletelyKfan MK definitely had something done to her mouth and cheeks. Ashley still looks kinda normal <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> So excited to see @KimKardashian meet @MyleezaKardash tonight! Stoked to see Kim's New Orleans trip! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I would be excited that Bey is teaming up with TopShop if she didn't wear the ugliest prints I've ever seen. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Kimblagh I love Bey but this collection is going to be a bunch of ugly ass prints cause that's all she wears. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KompletelyKfan @itsKELSEYtho drugs man. They'll age the crap out of you lol <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @KompletelyKfan he looks like asparagus. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @KimKendallKy they don't understand the influence she has. The Time list is about more than just humanitarian efforts too. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KimKendallKy did these idiots not say the same thing last year?? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kim_kanye_ I think it's sweet. It's nice bonding time for all of them! Keeps them close! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It's so cute that Kourt shares a bed with her babies. https://t.co/nmXNpZikQk <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Also how do you have the energy or time to make a twitter account for your like 5 hour old baby!? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @scottkardashx that totally makes sense. Knowing how people usually talk about Kim and all. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Seriously though, people in this fandom are good at finding info. They seem to know everything before it happens lol! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I also love how someone did a 9 hour seminar about Kim and it took us stans 2 days to find out about it! How is that possible?! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I love seeing people recognize the true impact Kim has. Instead of just writing her off like usual. The #Kimposium sounds interesting! <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Like who makes a twitter account for their hours old infant? Other than like a 15 year old. Wtf is the point of that? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> OK maybe I'm wrong about Coco faking the pregnancy. Looking back on the bump it's not that small. The baby is still a publicity stunt imo. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KompletelyKfan lol I feel ya! It's nice talking to someone who gets itA <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @MolestMeKardash: Omg the tickets for the #Kimposium were all sold out!!! It was a 10 hour conference on the #KKWImpact <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @KompletelyKfan but then you try to be a cold bitch and it eats away at you cause its not who you are. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @bamafan29203 they used to say she was using North for publicity but we barely saw her for the first year of her life. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KompletelyKfan I feel you 100%. No matter how bad it gets I can't stop caring. People just take how much you care for granted. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KompletelyKfan I think the people who care will never stop cause that's how we're built. The careless people take advantage of that. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @_xmarissabee @NailahShy idk I just don't buy it. Her bump was so tiny her whole pregnancy and they seem very fake about it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NailahShy cuuuuutiessssss <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> They had this baby for publicity. She lied about being pregnant for publicity. https://t.co/A6L0rremMh <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @bamafan29203 definitely. She did not give birth to that baby. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Coco can post all the pics of her bare belly she wants, that baby did not come out of her. Her fake belly was way too small. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NailahShy lmfao is she for real!? No way she was actually pregnant. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @KompletelyKfan they definitely shouldn't be together though. She doesn't deserve to be treated like that. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KompletelyKfan I definitely agree with you. I hope they're just being friendly. It's not fair to the kids to go back and forth like that. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KompletelyKfan cause when Kris divorced Robert it was super hard on Kourt. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KompletelyKfan I totally agree. I think maybe she keeps going back because she wants her kids to have their mom and their dad together. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KompletelyKfan are they back together again!? I had hoped she would stay away especially considering he doesn't seem changed. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> In 2015 I got myself together and went back to school. So 2016 is the year I'm going to get my money together. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> And if I get those 6 more hours I can start to come up out of my overdraft. I can do this, I know I can. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> As it stands right now I'm about $50 short of covering everything every month. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> My boss told me that some hours will free up in the new year so fingers crossed that's sooner rather than later. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> In 2016 I'm going to get my finances in order. I just need 6 more hours to free up in the pharmacy and I can do it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Just saw that KFed came for Beyonce and I could cry I'm laughing so hard! <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @KimKardashian gorgeous!!!! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MyleezaKardash the fact that people will trample each other to get those deals is so ridiculous. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KutieNameKim she did indeed. I wouldn't be here without asking myself WWKKWD: What would Kim Kardashian West do? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> When my site goes live I'm gonna email a link to my old boss and be like thanks for setting me on the right path by firing me 😊😊😊 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I could cry though y'all. I was so depressed last year after losing my job. Never imagined I'd be where I am now. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> At this time last year I was just realizing I had any skill at all. Now I'm sitting here looking at my first hand coded website. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @scottkardashx what did crazy pants do now? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KompletelyKfan I wouldn't want the kid around if I were her. Everyone calls her a teenage stepmom when they go out together. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KompletelyKfan he's complete trash <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KompletelyKfan he totally didn't buy the car. She bought it and made him pretend to give it to her cause he's a dog that follows her around <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KompletelyKfan I think so yeah. Donda did the design for the cover of his last album, the one that flopped miserably 😂 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AndreiaNoel exactly! She's trying to make them Kimye 2.0 but he's not on the level she needs to do that. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @AndreiaNoel I think she likes the attention her scandalous relationship brings her cause she lived in Kendall's shadow for so long. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AndreiaNoel see the thing is, I don't think she cares what her sisters have to say about him. She likes him cause he bugs her family. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I have no idea why but I do my school stuff 10× more efficiently with music on that I do without it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AndreiaNoel no doubt! Also I hope she doesn't do what Kim did at her age and marry him. I hope she learned from Kim's mistake! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AndreiaNoel I'm just praying he doesn't knock her up 😣 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AndreiaNoel I'm still mad at her for taking him back again <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KompletelyKfan nah I doubt it, it's still Tyga after all. Even Ye couldn't help him 😂😂 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AndreiaNoel right? He spends more time with Kylie than his child <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> No one who actually went to rehab and got sober and wanted to stay sober would put themselves in a scenario to be tempted. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Scott can say he got clean &amp; rehab helped but he's doing the club appearances cause that's his "job", and we all know it's a lie. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @itsKELSEYtho hahahahaha I know right?! You'd never know we're 24. But legit the way Zayn quit 1D was petty as fuck. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> At some point Scott has to stop mourning his loss and going poor me and do something about his problems. I thought he was, but I guess not. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Scott's parents passing was awful, and I get him spiraling a little after that. However it's been nearly 2 years and he's a father of 3. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Scott can play the victim all he wants but at some point you have to try to get your shit together. If not for yourself, for your kids. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @itsKELSEYtho Joe is cuter imo too. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm heartbroken for when Mason, Penelope, &amp; Reign watch these episodes. It's terrible to see him choose partying over them. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @AndreiaNoel yeah its basically like the child version of this. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Between the orange spray tans and the hulk style muscles, nothing about this is attractive. It's a truly disgusting trend. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It wouldn't bother me if what they were doing was actually healthy, but it's not. They starve themselves for better muscle definition. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Anti social justice people are just as annoying as social justice people. Nobody is accomplishing anything, but at least one side is trying. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Twitter trolls serve no purpose in our society. They think they're doing something by bitching and whining but you're doing nothing... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KimKendallKy it seems like she's trying too hard to be something she's not. The hipster look worked so well on her. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Milmoderate but clearly you're just an asshole, based on your feed so adios. Not debating something with someone set on being a dick. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Milmoderate none of this shifts focus from the bigger picture. Small things lead to big changes. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Queen_KourtneyK oh lol I'm an idiot haha sorry doll! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KimKendallKy it's usually when she wears something that looks close to her old style. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Queen_KourtneyK I'm pretty sure it's Cher's signature style too. It's not exactly an uncommon hairdo. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KimKendallKy she looked so beautiful here. Her style totally changed when she started dating him <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KimKendallKy they look awful. Her lips on KUWTK when she has no lipstick on is just scary. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KimKendallKy he turned her into a joke. Nobody takes her seriously at all. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KimKendallKy truth. I just hope her reputation can recover from this when she does actually dump him. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KimKendallKy I don't think it was but it looks like a mess. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KimKendallKy he ruined her reputation completely! And now it's gonna look like the faked the break up for publicity 😑 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KimKendallKy right? Clearly that "breakup" didn't last long... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Kylie looks awkward as hell in pics with Kendall from tonight. Kendall looks fierce as hell and Kylie's just kind of standing there 😕 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Back to the bottom of the list you go Kylie... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KimKendallKy your thoughts on Tyga showing up in Kylie's snaps? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KimKendallKy yeah its very costumey <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ainsleychapmaan 😣😣😣😣 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Seriously though can someone else watch Kylie's latest snap and tell me if that's Tyga.... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KimKendallKy 2015 wouldn't be so bad without those hideous sleeves. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Is that Tyga in Kylie's latest snap 😒 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KimKendallKy I 100% agree. She has what it takes. Despite what people think she's worked so hard for this and come so far! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KimKendallKy totally! I love that you put these pics together because it's amazing to see her become the supermodel she is! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I love how you can see her confidence building. She goes from shy, to comfortabl, to owning that red carpet! https://t.co/Uxv9W9kMuI <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Other than the sleeves Kylie looks incredible. That hair is so gorgeous! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Ugh Kylie's dress is so cute except for the sleeve things! They ruin the whole thing 😣 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KimKendallKy totally! She's just been killing it this year period! She really came into her own this year. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> She went from girl to woman here.  https://t.co/hKzmT99rbS <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KimKendallKy 2015!!! Those bangs are incredible!!! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Thank god for Kris Jenner handing Scott his ass. Like I actually can't believe how he was acting. So rude it's unreal. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm hoping rehab helped Scott understand what he did wrong because he's so delusional about it. He does not get it at all. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Wow Scott skipped his kids first day of school and then went and partied that night?! That's just terrible... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I agree that Kourtney should do the promo for the kids stuff. I mean she's all about the kid stuff. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Lmfao at @KimKardashian &amp; @khloekardashian saying "Those aren't organic sprinkles" in unison 😂😂😂😂 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Awww I wanna see that video of North and Mason ballroom dancing! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I won't lie I do think Kourt needs to step up the work when it comes to Kardashian products. Kim has North and still works ya know? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @DaRealNiecey: From watching #KUWTK over the years we know who the REAL STRONGEST in the family is and it's  KIM period  #KUWTK ,don't  … <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kim_kanye_ she sucks up to Khloe so hard it's embarrassing. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Lmfao @KimKardashian's face when she was eating the avocado mix is hilarious 😂😂 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Malika truly does live up Khloe's ass. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Aww Khloe and Kourt on the phone with Caitlyn and Candace was so cute! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Mason's voice is soooo cute! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I seriously love seeing outfits we've seen in candids on the show. It's like hey I remember when @KimKardashian wore that! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KimKardashian hope you're feeling well today! You're looking gorgeous! Your boy is almost here!!!! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Looool @ what Kourtney eats. It's always so strange and suuuuper healthy! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Love @KimKardashian going on tweet sprees during #KUWTK! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Thank goodness for PVR's so I can watch @KimKardashian on #KUWTK even though I wrk until 7pm on Sunday! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KimKendallKy and she's jealous she has none of her own. Or I guess at that point had none of her own. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KimKendallKy I think she's pissed she has to do all the Kardashian stuff cause Kim is too busy with independent projects. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Off in 10 minutes and then it's home to lasagna and KUWTK!!!! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @KimKardashian: Yaaaaassssssss slay the AMA's sisters!!!! slay away..... 🔥🔥🔥 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Milmoderate @chrissyteigen this isn't about "pubes on dolls" it's about making sure girls grow up feeling good about themselves. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Milmoderate @chrissyteigen dolls that aren't completely hairless. Because body hair on women is natural. Not sorry if that grosses you out. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Milmoderate @chrissyteigen you can try to minimize it and make it stupid but that doesn't mean it won't impact young women to have <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Why are these Queen's standing with a couple of Z listers???  https://t.co/QpVmFwGD6c <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> This is the one thing that makes me dislike her. She doesn't get why people do this kind of thing. https://t.co/hAUBYWWf5t <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Like remember the time our Prime Minister honored Bieber and he wore some crusty ass overalls? So disrespectful, no class at all. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Bieber is the least classy individual ever. He dresses like a teenage fuck boy. I've seen 15 year olds dress better. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I would like this if it didn't have the weird leather arm cuffs. Her makeup looks incredible though! https://t.co/jvBqHRbVEV <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> HEY BEAUTIFUL 😍😍😍😍😍 https://t.co/qw3oshzbtw <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Dear @FrankieJGrande please stop trying to make yourself happen. You will always be Ariana's annoying brother, nothing else. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MolestMeKardash totally and he never will be. He'll forever be Ariana Grande's really annoying brother. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MolestMeKardash his existence is waaaaay too much. He's trying to prove he doesn't belong in Ariana's shadow but we all know he does <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Celebrities are so far separated from the real world, they don't understand the problems of the common man. No matter what they say. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Certain stars should just leave certain topics alone in the public forum, privileged people have no idea what's truly going on. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chrissyteigen love you but you're missing the mark here. Wanting dolls to give girls a more realistic body image is not "PC outrage" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It's not "fake PC outrage" like Chrissy says. It's a legitimate request. Body hair is natural, we should be teaching that to kids. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The reason why people are asking for dolls with leg hair and arm hair is to give them a more realistic body image while they grow up. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Chrissy Teigan is beautiful, funny, &amp; witty but let's not act like she's a scholar of any kind. She should stay quiet about political things <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> This is the only reason I dislike her. She really doesn't get why people do this stuff. https://t.co/hAUBYWWf5t <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Her jawline and cheekbones have not changed at all. Kim's cheeks are more defined now because she contours. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> She also changed her brows. Which has a huge affect on the way your eyes look. She has a more rounded arch now. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Kim's lips get bigger when she's pregnant cause she tends to swell up. Her preeclampsia caused her entire body to swell with North. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Then they say she has lip injections, but those two pictures are like 6 years apart and her lips are exactly the same.. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> And then dark makeup on the sides to make her nose look skinnier. The actual structure of her nose has not changed. No surgery. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> People say Kim got a nose job but literally all it is is contouring. She puts hilighter on the bottom of her nose to make it look shorter. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @KimKanyeKimYe2: #FBF Three looks @KimKardashian wore from @Balmain Fall 2012 collection. #RunwayToRealLife https://t.co/d59UdkSQke <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @scottkardashx and she was using jackets to cover her stomach! She's so brave for wearing that dress while hiding a pregnancy! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @scottkardashx I legit had no idea until she said herself. I thought it was all rumors but when you look back, her boobs were huge lol <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Tyga did not buy her that car. He does not have that kind of money. Kylie bought that car for herself and had him pretend to give it to her. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> #WeLoveYouKylie!! It's all for the best!!! ❤❤❤ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It's kind of sad that those St. Barts episodes are on this weekend, for Kylie I mean. I can stomach those scenes now knowing he's gone. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @scottkardashx I remember OK mag put out a cover of her in this dress saying she was pregnant before she announced and I didn't believe them <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm so happy she got out of that relationship before he knocked her up. She's waaaaay too good for that. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Kimblagh she is going to look fierce as hell. We all know how the Kardashian-Jenner women handle their breakups. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> In all seriousness I hope @KylieJenner is ok. Break ups are never easy. I hope she knows now she deserves more. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> So my list is now:
Kim
Kendall
Kourtney
Kylie
Kris
Khloe 

King Kylie got bumped up cause she made a smart decision today. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KimKendallKy LMFAO!!! <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @Kimblagh @fayelali this person is not trying to insinuate that Blac Chyna is a "good girl"... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> She truly should try out music. The few snippets of Kylie singing are really good. Nothing makes a better song than a break up 😉 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Now Kylie needs to do what the girls always do and channel that break up energy into an amazing career move. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Well if E is saying it then it's completely true. 😃😃😃😃 https://t.co/cWJuiICMmC <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KompletelyKfan she tried to pretend it was a sharpie drawing not a tattoo by getting her fans to write her name on their hands 😂😂😂 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Also I give it a week before Tyga runs back to Chyna. She'll take him back because she doesn't respect herself enough not to. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Kyga is finally dead y'all. Now Princess Kylie can go find her a proper Prince who respects her and is age appropriate. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KompletelyKfan looool nah she got Future's name tatted on her hand and like 2 days later he publicly declared himself single 😂 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Adios Tyga, now you get to join Kris H and French Montana in the land of Kardashian rejects 😊 <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @NailahShy that's how mine used to be then Kenny did the VS show lol <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I thought it was kind of suspicious when he didn't follow her to Australia. Tyga follows Kylie everywhere so his absence was noted. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @itsKELSEYtho @KimKendallKy TMZ said she was a no show at his birthday party! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Kylie made no mention of Tyga's birthday anywhere, she didn't show up at his party, she hasn't posted anything in 2 days. They broke up.. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Why the hell should women care for you when you don't respect them? Why should they do anything for you? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> We don't exist to take care of you, cater to you, feed your ego, and have sex with you. Those are perks that come when respect is given. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> And a lot of the men who want a real relationship are just looking for someone to take care of them, like their mom would. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> I'm not saying Khloe &amp; James should break up, but I think they should keep the relationship out of the public eye while Lamar recovers. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> She shouldn't be parading around with James Harden when Lamar is still lying in a hospital bed. It's not appropriate. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Cars are not toys despite what the Fast &amp; Furious movies make you think. They're dangerous and need to be handled responsibly. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm only saying this because I nearly died in 2 car accidents, both of which were caused by my own reckless behavior. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Paul Walker's death was preventable but not by Porsche. It was preventable by not racing a sports car. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> They were racing sports car at a high speed. Not saying it's their fault, but it's not the fault of the maker of the car. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> What happened to Paul Walker was sad as hell, but it was the result of reckless behavior on his part and the driver's part. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> OK unpopular opinion time but I don't think Paul Walker's daughter has any right to sue Porsche for his death.... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm excited at the idea Kim might give birth next week but I'm also sad cause that means 3 months of silence from Kimmy 😩 <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> RT @itsKELSEYtho: She then had to post a picture proving that she was really pregnant (the picture slayed btw) but no woman should actually… <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> So if the doctors are gonna induce her around Thanksgiving does that mean baby boy might be here by the end of next week!?!! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KimKardashian you're the sweetest mommy to her. Your babies are lucky to have you! Stay safe in these next few weeks mama ❤ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> This is my favorite picture today. https://t.co/8KiaoQyywk <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @smoodgie people just want to hate on her and the media feeds into that hate with their misleading headlines <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> When you have another being literally squishing your lungs to half their size, you are allowed to complain. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Pregnant woman are allowed to complain all the fucking time if they want. They're literally creating life, they can be cranky. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @itsKELSEYtho literally another human being is growing inside of you, nothing about that is comfortable. They can complain all they want. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @itsKELSEYtho it's not rainbows and sunshine for anyone! People want to pretend pregnancy is magic but it's a huge strain on the body. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> How dare you get upset with a pregnant woman trying to keep herself and her baby safe. If you're bothered by Kim K inducing, get fucked. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Right? The fact that she has to keep stressing that she's grateful to be pregnant is infuriating. https://t.co/yKe3V9PsUL <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> People are so cruel about Kim's pregnancies. They treat her like she's selfish for taking health precautions so her children have a mother. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KutieNameKim right? She has to protect herself and the baby. Her health being at risk puts the baby at risk. She's just being safe! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @itsKELSEYtho exactly! And that's not safe for her. The larger the baby gets the more strain is put on her body. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> How dare anyone try to insinuate that Kim's baby will be born early for any other reason than her health. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> If the baby has grown enough and the mother is potentially in danger, of course they'll induce. They're trying to keep her alive. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The last month of pregnancy is primarily growth for the baby. Everything has developed so the baby is just growing. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> People are gonna say Kim lied about the due date, but her baby is already 7lbs at 8 months so the chances of her carrying to term are slim. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It's like when the media was saying that the fact that she might have to have a hysterectomy was for vanity reasons, not her health. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @usweekly it's cruel of you to word this like she's just changing an appointment in her calendar, all so you can get clicks from haters.. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> I'm sympathetic to all the regular people who get HIV in any way, but not to Charlie Sheen. He did this to himself. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GeishaGirl68 saying he did drugs and slept with hookers is a fact, it's also a fact that those things led to him getting HIV. Not judgments <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Before you give Charlie Sheen any sympathy don't forget that he's a raging misogynist who beats women. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Charlie Sheen is disgusting, my opinion on that doesn't change because he got himself infected with HIV by being reckless. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MolestMeKardash  have you heard from her lately? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm sympathetic to the women Charlie Sheen lied to and did not disclose his status to because wanted to maintain a reputation. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> OK I can't stand how the media is treating Charlie Sheen like he's a helpless victim. No he has HIV cause he did drugs and slept w/hookers. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Kourtney manages all the behind the scenes business. Kim has all of her independent projects, the game, fragrances, etc. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Khloe does the promo work for the Kardashian stuff because she has nothing else to do. She's got nothing independent from the brand. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> You know it's bad when the best looking person in the group is Napoleon Dynamite. #inbreeding #incestisnotbest https://t.co/iyaCuffoN0 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Kylie's contour for Elle Canada makes her face look skeletal and old. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> They steal the focus from her eyes. https://t.co/DZQbS5KQKh <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KimKendallKy they look so unnaturally swollen. Like her lips got stung by bees. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> She's so adorable! https://t.co/TMrSyXgAec <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @I_yler: A woman should never feel/be ashamed to embrace their sexuality. https://t.co/BaL7xZcz0m <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MolestMeKardash this is the worst question that has ever been asked lol. I physically cannot vote for either of them. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @scottkardashx he's such a little shit. His fans stick by him when he's behaving like a fuck boy and then he repays them with a w/ a 2k M&amp;G <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Not at all surprised that Charlie Sheen has HIV. Between all the hookers, drugs, and porn stars it was only a matter of time.. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Lol I remember reading a blind item a few weeks ago about how some male celebrity was HIV positive. Now Charlie Sheen has an announcement... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Kimblagh completely agree. If you blame every Muslim for terrorist attacks you better blame every white person when a white boy shoots ppl. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> So no, Tyga is not a nice guy. He's a creepy predator. Just wait, Kylie will get too old for him and he'll move on... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Also there is nothing "nice" about a man who leaves the mother of his child for a teenage girl. If you think that's nice, you're crazy. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It's always funny to me when people are lie "but what if Tyga is really nice to Kylie", I don't fucking care he's still creepy. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Kylie probably begged Kris to let Tyga be on the show, since all she does these days is try to give that loser a career. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Why does he have to be on the show? I liked it before when they had to hide their creepy relationship.  https://t.co/wDDYbjwr0P <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @I_yler you're so cute! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Kimblagh I'll never understand how people make connections like this. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @I_yler every time I try to debate anything with anyone lol <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Women in #yyc act like their Coach and MK bags are the same as a Birkin bag, it's ridiculous. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NailahShy it's everyone up here. Like all these bitches buy is MK and Coach. And they're like look at my amazing designer bag 😩 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NailahShy exactly they know they have to keep Kanye safe! Kanye and the good weed 😂 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I barely know anything about fashion but I know that Coach &amp; MK are not what anyone would call high fashion. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Girls in #yyc walk around with their Coach &amp; Michael Kors bags and act like that means they know fashion 😂😂😂 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NailahShy either that or their fans of some celebrities and don't wanna risk hurting them 😂😂😂 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NailahShy LMFAOOOOOOOOOOOOOO that's why they leave the west coast alone, it's where the good weed is 😂😂😂 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NailahShy true but so does New York and Washington DC. LA just isn't a likely choice for a politically motivated attack. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NailahShy remember what I said about terrorists focusing their attention on the east coast cause of the politicians and banks <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Lol Ronda Rousey is getting burned all over the place 😂 https://t.co/dNfM0lHoVH <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Hey guys, follow the twitter for my design company ❤ https://t.co/PLJJkp54eh <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Fuck my life my ipod just died 😣😣😣😣😣😣 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Plus it only contains the 5 girls and Kris which shows how the show has evolved from being about a family, to being about boss bitches 😂 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The new KUWTK theme is so symbolic though. It's the exact opposite of the goofy family intro, it's all glamour. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @scottkardashx that's so awesome. It was like foreshadowing lol <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @scottkardashx really? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It like can't hold sound equipment so big acts always go to Edmonton or Vancouver instead. 😬😬😬😬😬😬😬 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Seriously some idiot thought we needed a saddle shaped stadium and because of it we never get concerts cause the roof is fucked. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Goddammit of course they're not coming to Calgary. Stupid saddle shaped stadium making it impossible to hold equipment 😬😬😬 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> All because she was bold enough to express her dissatisfaction with George Bush and the Iraq war. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Seriously though the fact that someone told Natalie Maines she should shut up and sing or they would kill her is ridiculous. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I got bored one day and watched the Dixie Chicks documentary Shut Up &amp; Sing and I've loved them ever since ❤ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> WAIT THE ACTUAL DIXIE CHICKS AS IN ALL 3 OF THEM ARE GOING ON TOUR AGAIN?!?!?!? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @itsKELSEYtho we'll have to find an ass doctor and assk them 😂😂😂 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Talking with @itsKELSEYtho about people becoming ass doctors and I'm laughing so hard I'm crying 😂😂😂😂 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Oh just @KimKardashian teaching me about preeclampsia and placenta accreta on this Monday morning 😂 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @itsKELSEYtho right!? It's giving me a pretty horrifying mental picture too. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> People bash @KimKardashian for being honest about her pregnancy, but I think it's brave as hell. I've learned so much from her. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I mean after having a baby I can't imagine a doctors arm going up into your uterus is very comfortable 😵😵😵😵 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Holy shit the part about Kim's doctor having to scrape out her placenta is just horrifying holy crap. Poor Kimberly 😣 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @khloekardashian girl those waist trainers are not good for your organs. You shouldn't bend your ribs into place like that... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Question for artistic people, are you able to do your art/work without music? I absolutely must have music playing while designing. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> My favorite part about growing up is listening to songs you loved as a kid and realizing how dirty they were 😂😂😂 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> 😆😆😆😆😆 it would be higher but my dumbass forgot background music in one of my videos 😣 https://t.co/0ebEg5yOng <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I didn't think I'd learned anything from it cause I was super confused but it's making these lessons so easy! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Man HTML for Dummies will teach you more than you think. We're going through basic HTML and it's so easy cause of that book. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm about to start blasting Kanye &amp; Taylor Swift just to show this guy how rude he is, and also what good music sounds like 😉 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Never go to community college. You will be trapped in a room with a bunch of derelict idiots who will never succeed in life. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Got this douchebag in class who brags about doing community service. He has no headphones so he forces us all to listen to metal all day 😬 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> None of my classmates seem to be able to submit assignments on time and I'm like how? I'm done stuff early all the time <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KutieNameKim yeah that's not worth it lol. He seems like a lot of work 😂 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @itsKELSEYtho right? They charge so much for concert tickets &amp; want even more $$$ after that it's ridiculous <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KutieNameKim you better get to take some of his hair for $2000 lol <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @itsKELSEYtho right? 2 grand is insanity. I mean $500 is a lot but I get charging around that amount for a M&amp;G. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I truly don't understand people who like Bieber. Sure his music is catchy, but people who like Bieber as a human confuse me. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KutieNameKim right? It's sick. His fans are mostly like teen girls and he wants them to pay 2 grand to meet his bratty ass. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Awww the Calgary tower is still blue, red, &amp; white for Paris. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> There are artists out there who offer their M&amp;G's for free cause they actually care about their fans. Bieber's fans are nothing but $ to him <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Lmfao Bieber's fans are mad he's charging 2k for meet &amp; greets. Maybe try stanning for someone who isn't greedy... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 https://t.co/fkNUkDIVdf <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @KimKendallKy: North trying to eat ice again 😂😂 https://t.co/u7Fu3LBRKK <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Kimblagh the beat drop is so amazing! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Khloe never misses a chance to throw shade at Kim. Kim's encouraging her to do a sexy shoot and Khloe says it's weird to have your ass out. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @catzmccrea she actually has 😊 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @catzmccrea also just a suggestion lay off the tanning beds, leather skin isn't cute 😉 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @catzmccrea still doesn't answer my question... probably cause you can't 😊 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KelsBels86 @catzmccrea @ENews who rattled yours? Why are you so bothered by Kim K? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Yas!!!! https://t.co/p6bSXX5hZ0 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @SaaaarahJ66 @ENews don't follow E then, it's the channel their show is on, so of course they're gonna report about the Kardashians... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @catzmccrea @ENews what does how she dresses have to do with her pregnancy being high risk?? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I have to go to sleep now, goodnight @KimKardashian &amp; @KrisJenner! Thank you for 11 seasons of KUWTK! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Kimblagh @KimKardashian definitely. I just try to appreciate that she takes the time to tweet us, not everyone does that! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I feel like @KimKardashian sees all of our tweets but she just can't reply to every single one. I know she reads them all though! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm so grateful my PVR records every episode of #KUWTK so I can rewatch them over and over @KimKardashian @KrisJenner <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @itsKELSEYtho yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaas!!!! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @khloekardashian @KutieNameKim congrats doll!!! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KimKendallKy I get that. He's pretty artistic with the way he films his videos so I can see why he wouldn't be a big fan of their filming. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @favoritesgirI yes because running around all over the world modelling in shows is nothing. No hard work at all. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @favoritesgirI lmfao she didn't design that app. A team of graphic designers did. She gets no credit for that. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @favoritesgirI she didn't have to work for!? Please... Like Kylie has to work for the shit she has handed to her... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> 😍😍😍 https://t.co/tTUAotApXi <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KimKendallKy my guess is he does it as a favor to his wifey but asks them to limit his scenes? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @favoritesgirI she may be more controversial but she's not more relevant. Kendall was prepping to walk runways at 17, Kylie was with Tyga <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Like yes Kylie's app is successful and she has this lip stuff coming out, but let's not act like she's on the level Kendall was at 18. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DaRealNiecey lmfao true!!!!!! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Mommy mode 😍 https://t.co/faPR9VBwYY <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Kendall is 150% right about Kylie. She's too worried about Tyga and his career. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> "She doesn't have her priorities straight" Kendall on Kylie. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Awww mommy @KimKardashian playing with Northie's curls!!!! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KimKardashian @khloekardashian she looked so amazing. You're so sweet being so supportive! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KimKanyeKimYe2 right? Reminded me of the pics of her at the brunch! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KimKardashian you're the cutest mommy ever! I love seeing you talk to Northie. She's so sweet ❤ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> "And the P star?" Omg she's the most precious baby 😍😍😍😍😍 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Awwwwwww Northie!!!!!!!!!!! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Lol the Jenner kids are so petty having their faces blurred on the show... <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @kourtneykardash we love you too! You're such a strong woman and an amazing mother! Always hoping for the best for you ❤❤❤❤❤ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Awwww bb Reign. We barely ever see him lol <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Khloe looks good. Kim is right. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Honestly though @KimKardashian is so level headed. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I miss the whistle though. It's perfect for season 11 to have a new intro but the whistle is so classic. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @marieclaire: Watch @kendalljenner's *amazing* beauty transformation https://t.co/NKqZt86CyF <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KimKanyeKimYe2 that's so cute that they got those customized! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KimKanyeKimYe2 was that a part of the gift baskets from the brunch? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @itsKELSEYtho: With an hour left, here's a look at some season promos through the years. #KUWTK season 11 will be dope! https://t.co/Wx0… <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Look at how gorgeous she is when she doesn't let her makeup artists cover her in too much eyeshadow. https://t.co/gUmrdNEj5c <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> First Rebel Wilson gets called out by Oprah, then Ronda Rousey gets kicked in the face. Not a good time to be talking shit about Kim KW <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Ronda Rousey got kicked in the face by karma and it was beautiful. It's not even just Kim, she behaves like a child having a tantrum. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @MarioFloresss: This is why she lost tonight  https://t.co/eZKbj7KTxl <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @itsKELSEYtho: Ronda Rousey dissed KKW.... Then lost her fight. Do wrong by Kim and you will face the consequences. 🤔🤔 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Nice seeing all the KKW haters getting clocked by karma 😊 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It's nice to see Kylie hanging with Willow &amp; Jaden again. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @itsKELSEYtho you're welcome boo <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @itsKELSEYtho you look so cute! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> .@RondaRousey say all you want about Kim's sex tape, at least she's never beat one of her boyfriends and openly preached hate. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Ronda Rousey is a genuinely horrible human being yet some how she thinks she has any right to pass judgement?! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It's okay for @RondaRousey to say that a Transgender woman shouldn't be associated with the UFC, but Kim is a bad role model!? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Ronda Rousey is proud that she beat up her boyfriends. Because abusing your partner is an okay thing to do, cause they're guys right? 😒 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> As if Ronda Rousey has a right to speak on anyone's role model status when she preaches transphobia &amp; is abusive.  https://t.co/WTYVWs41HS <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Since when is @RondaRousey a role model? https://t.co/eZ9HNL0T0N via @Salon <Text_End>
