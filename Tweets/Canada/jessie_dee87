<Text_Begin> RT @Fallout: The final #12DaysofFallout 's upon us and what a joy it's been - have a bundle of items and a guide! RT to win! https://t.co/j‚Ä¶ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I miss the days when toys came in normal size boxes; now you almost need an engineering degree to wrap them properly <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> My excuse for not wrapping gifts right now: babies are sleeping <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Yaye!  Opened my tv on @CTVCanadaAM and @melissagrelo is co-hosting, awesome start to the morning üòä. Bring smiles all around <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I have my best ideas at 2am...  2am also happens to be my laziest time <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It doesn't matter if you hear the Deathclaw, you will sh*t your pants every time it pops out! #Fallout4 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> How can babies who can't even crawl travel so much in their crib?!? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheSocialCTV I laughed!  My mom was completely grey by 30, as well as my grandma, so I knew it was bound to happen <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheSocialCTV Fake Charlie Brown tree...  Only because we don't have room for a tree, but still trying to be festive <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> At least the babies ate and I made my coffee before the power went out #lucky <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The storm was yesterday, and we lose power today! :S #Winter <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheSocialCTV couldn't do it myself (too easily grossed out), but if you can do it, that's awesome; many great benefits <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheSocialCTV my hubby people watches, but never looks directly at them, there lies the difference. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Oh no!!!!  Snow is starting!  #notwinteryet <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheSocialCTV I buy/make presents for those that matter to me, kids or adults.  This year, fam members will get nice framed pic of my twins. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheSocialCTV @amyschumer it's an awesome way of sticking it to the man!  If this happens: Kudos! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> What's up with cats and dryers?! #sillycat #stayathomemomtruth <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheSocialCTV Never, the relationship is over for a reason, no need to dig that up again. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheSocialCTV This is totally a doubled edge sword. They release info about celebs and he's one of them <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheSocialCTV isn't it sad that in this day and age, we are still looking at looks to determine if someone is competent in the workplace <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheSocialCTV Since having my twins, I love my body, stretch marks and all, more than before having my boys <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Funny how a crowd applauding kinda sounds like rain on a tin roof <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheSocialCTV the last gift I got from my grandma is a blessed angel pin, it's in my luggage at all times, so she's with me always <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheSocialCTV I prefer to live in the moment, having my kids see me in those special times and not a camera <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheSocialCTV it's obvious that everything she does is to make ppl take notice of her and talk about her...  This is just another stunt <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> #cdnpoli  https://t.co/W4HUfIP1dq <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheSocialCTV I would share out of the goodness of my heart, but if you ask for money because you're family, you will not get any <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> My house is the Bermuda Triangle for iPhone chargers... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheSocialCTV @cynthialoyst totally agree with that choice!  What would be person of the year without s little controversy <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheSocialCTV Chris O'Dowd!  Very sexy!  Plus the accents! *sigh* <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheSocialCTV I do only when I really mean it, but I don't do it to everyone; I won't give a false compliment <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheSocialCTV I don't think so, why do we feel that whenever a woman shares her biological experience, it's TMI &amp; bad.  It's human nature <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Baby clothes sizes: 0-3mths, 3mths, 3-6mths?!?  Aren't they all the same size?!? O_O <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> You cannot explain to a cat that the mini humans (babies) can't use their hands with the same agility as their regular humans <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Hubby playing #Fallout4 : "He ate my bullets like they were Pop Rocks" lol! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Going to get my #Starbucks fix with the fam!  ‚ù§Ô∏è <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheSocialCTV yes, we need to be more honest about it, whether it's good or bad.  And not be afraid to share our fears and thoughts about it <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheSocialCTV didn't hate it, but the lack of comfort at the end was unsettling (carried my twin boys full term) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheSocialCTV never!  But rational discussions, yes, I think it's important for them to see that it's possible to disagree w/out fighting <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheSocialCTV it's at the brides' discretion.  If she doesn't want anyone wearing white, that's ok, but I don't see the big deal <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @BuzzFeed: Tina Fey and Amy Poehler are hosting SNL TOGETHER on December 19!!!! https://t.co/VPiqKbmey7 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Finding so others in the randomness places; one in my Christmas cactus, another in the washer...  They are worse than socks... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> What the?!  Snow?!? üòñüò≤üò∑. Ewww! Please Mother Nature, wait 'til mid-December at least! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> New iPad!  Means hours of resetting all my stuff!  Woot! <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Being a mom means wearing the same shirt as yesterday even if babies puked on it because they will likely do it again... And they did! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Feels like I have 2 little owls in my house with all the hooting going on...  At least it not crying <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Yaye!!  Got my boys' clothes order today!  They will look cute this winter! Guess that's being a mom <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> #Fallout4 out in a few short hours, will pester hubby to buy it tonight on #ps4 to have it first thing tmr when I get up! üòã <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> When babies sleep, fur baby be like "Cuddle time!!!" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheSocialCTV Makes sense, there are studies showing food ads boast hunger, food porn is the same <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Fallout Vault 108 "Garyyyy!" <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @TheSocialCTV @jessieraeallen for that opportunity, I would've picked Firenze as well!  #mostbeautifulplaceonearth ‚ù§Ô∏è <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheSocialCTV I think that when children are involved, then yes, it's important to know how will be around the kids, but otherwise, no <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Whenever I take my boys out of their crib one at a time, I always think of Toy Story: "The Claw! Oooooooooh!" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheSocialCTV I don't know how I would feel having my kids txt their teacher though... <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> That moment when your twins start crying in their sleep at the same time O_O  Twin dreams maybe? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Do ppl think that being a mom makes you deaf? Kind of sad the comments you can hear while out with the little ones. But some nice 1s as well <Text_End>
