<Text_Begin> "I'll go by myself next year. I thought this was all about family and Ill feel so disrespected if they don't come" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> "for all that I've sacrificed for this vacation, if it doesn't work out then I'll start thinking about me and fuck everyone else..." <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> I'm tired as balls, but Bries still playing her game and "just ten more minutes" always turns out to be 2 hours <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I hate it when Brie and her mom fight in front of me. It's awkward, it's uncomfortable, and I can't say anythong <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Raptor squad is love, raptor squad is life <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I AM SO EMOTIONAL ABOUT JURASSIC WORLD <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Wake up mom, you are in an abusive relationship and its high time you realized that and kicked his ass to the curb. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> PARTNERS ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO MAKE YOU CRY UNLESS THEY ARE TEARS OF HAPPINESS <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I s2g I will unleash hell when I go over there because this is bullshit. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Half the time when my mom texts me, I don't even think it's her. The texting style is different and the wording is manipulative. Hmmm <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> You can't just fucking turn on a dime and ask me to completely change my plans to fit your agenda. That's not fucking fair. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @soapinthesock Truuuuue, but if I side with the Templars on those missions, I can get anywhere from +5 to +15 friendship with him c; <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I DONT KNOW WHY THESE POSTS IRRITATE ME SO MUCH BUT IM THIS CLOSE TO UNFOLLOWING ANYONE WHO POSTS THEM <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> AH YES GIANT SPIDERS I WAS WONDERING WHEN THEY WOULD SHOW UP <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Two more side quests to go and then onto the main plot finally xD <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Anders would be such an easy romance, but I'm such a sucker with elves that I just can't go for him ;___; <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @soapinthesock THIS IS BEAUTIFUL I HOEP I GET TO MEET SER POUNCE-A-LOT <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @soapinthesock AHHHHH I CANT WAIT! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Cullen still looks like someone took a pack of ramen noodles and pasted them to his head <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Why can't Anders and Fenris just get along? ;___; <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> FENRIS MY LOVE OH MY LORD <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Anders got a jaw line like whoa üòç <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Varric reminds me a lot of my old cat. All head and no neck <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm such a sucker for side quests. I'll be doing them all day today probably <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> JFC two deaths this early on? First Carver, then Wesley. At this rate, I'll have no companions at all <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @soapinthesock JFC I DIDNT EVEN DO ANYTHING EXCEPT EXSIST LIKE WHAT COULD I HAVE DONE WRONG ALREADY <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> WTF IM LIKE FIVE MINUTES IN AND CARVER ALREADY HATES ME <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> All right, time to binge play DA2 until Brie gets home from work <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> According to Facebook, five years ago today I "om nomed" a hot dog <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Ramsey Hawke has officially been made! Tomorrow the adventure begins. C: <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I only beat DA:O because the ballista GLITCHED when I was fighting the Archdemon and I killed that prick in less than 2 minutes <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> DA2 IM COMING FOR YOU <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I have to leave for work in an hour and I still need to get my shot yet here I am  still sitting on the couch <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @soapinthesock HOLY HELL THATS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @soapinthesock /SCREECHES/ WHAT A CUTIE omg <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> This really attractive French guy came into Build a Bear and he was so gorgeous that I literally could not speak properly around him <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I bit my tongue really hard tonight and now it's bruised. How the fuck do you bruise your tongue? <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @soapinthesock ITALIAN <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> You would think that maybe "zucchero" means zucchini just to make language a little easier but no IT MEANS FUCKING SUGAR <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Well that was an adventure. Time to wipe it clean and see how much 2nd gens are going for these days~ <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Oh shit I just found my old iPod nano from when I was sixteen. Let's charge this bad boy up and see what's on it <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Like fuck, I'm seven months on t and my voice is still high as ever and all of these guys have these amazing low voices <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Getting really emotional over FTM videos on YouTube right now. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Smfh for this so called "loving and accepting" family. No one but my dad truly gives a flying fuck. #rantover <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> He didn't invalidate my feelings or MISGENDER MY FUCKING GIRLFRIEND AND SAY THAT THEY ONLY USED FEMALE PRONOUNS FOR HER TO AMUSE ME <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> He didn't scream and cry and force me into a panic attack so severe that I had to be taken out of the room for my own safety <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> And when I came out to him as trans he DIDNT BAT A FUCKING EYELASH. He called me his son and told me to come to him for anything <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> No, he just smiled and gave me a hug and said "I always knew. Father's intuition. When do I get to meet your special girl?" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> He didn't go to a partners house during a sleepover to "warn" her mother that we were involved and tried to bring me home. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> He didn't tell me I was an embarrassment and to stop holding hands with my partners in public because family might see. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> When I told him I liked girls, he didn't tell me it was a phase and keep me from having any stable relationships. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Shit talk my dad all you want,
Mom. He's the only one in my whole fucking family who has loved me unconditionally. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> And then you've got Team Warden, elf assassin boyfriend, Mage baby mama, and third wheeling best friend. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Team Oghren, Sten, and Mabari. #teampowerhouse <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I told Zevran I loved him and he just said "I know." ;w; <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Goal for today: defeat the Archdemon before work. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Really not looking forward to this week at all. School till noon every day and then closing shifts every day till Friday. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Welp. Didn't beat DA:O tonight so I guess next weekend then? ;___; <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @soapinthesock BLESS YOUR BEAUTIFUL SOUL &lt;3 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @soapinthesock I forgot about him ;___; I did another quest before this one and didn't change my party <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> HOLY SHIT LOOK HOW VEINY MY HANDS ARE GOD DAMN http://t.co/Tcs58vhLcR <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Attempting to mount a life size plastic horse and go through an obstacle course while buzzed prooooobably wasn't the best idea either <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Only sliiiiightly hungover this morning. I now know that wine is not meant to be drunk out of a coffee mug. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Mom asked me to grab some celery and apples and I thought she told me to "accelerate the apples" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Board games and blanket forts tonight with some of my favourite people. C: <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I s2g I went to sleep with my shirt on the right way and I wake up and it's inside out and backwards??? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Class starts in half an hour. I guess I should get ready, heh. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Like how do I work my body? Do I look good with everyone else? Am I even in character? DIFFERENT POSES??? It's so stressful... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I mean they always sound like a fun idea but once I get to one all of a sudden it's pure terror <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I like going to conventions because the atmosphere is amazing, but photos freak me out and don't even get me started on photoshoots... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Cosplay is such an expensive hobby and I'm not even confident with it so why do I bother <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> On the bright side E3 is in less than two weeks and I am so pumped! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> What it leads to is me laying in bed half an hour after my alarm goes contemplating if I even want to go to class. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> No matter how many times I wake up groggy and gross, every semester I'm always like "Let's take the 9:00 class! Im sure I'll be fine." <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Next time I bring up morning classes, please spray with me cold water. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The Walking Dead is tearing me apart omg <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> All these tumblr posts are like "date someone who will treat you nice and touch your butt" like what kind of low standards are these??? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Awe yeah lookin' super fly with the babe~ http://t.co/tdbz7NypCo <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> NWFF was really great this year and our DMMD group got lots of pictures! C: <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Gonna start putting $50 every paycheque away for future stuff. Let's see how long this lasts. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I s2g if one more Final Fantasy game comes out before Kingdom Hearts 3 I may scream. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> This show is exactly like Game of Thrones in the sense of: don't pick a favourite or get attached because they're probs gonna die <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @SincerelyTumblr: do not cover the dark circles under your eyes, wear them proudly let the world know you're tired of its shit and aren'‚Ä¶ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Well this is it. I'm finally going to do it. Season One of The Walking Dead, here we go. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I feel sick to my stomach with anxiety yet I have nothing to be anxious about? Maybe I oughta lay off the caffeine for a while... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Idk I know that they're meant to be really nice but half the people saying them are 14/15 and I feel like I'm being coddled <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Like: "you're such a special flower in this big unfathomable universe; your existence is so important and you're doing so well" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Sometimes I just really hate those posts on tumblr that genuinely mean well but come off as kind of condescending? At least to me anyway. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> If swearing isn't your thing though stay far away because I s2g every sentence has a variation of "fuck" in it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Jbrynelson YOURE BACK IN CANADALAND?!?! EEEEEE &lt;3 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> A+ game if you like story based games where your choices influence the plot and reaction command style fighting. Sequel pls right meow <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I BEAT THE WOLF AMONG US AND HOLY CRAP WHAT A ROLLER COASTER AND WHAT A CLIFFHANGER <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> There's a machine that plants bad ideas in people's heads about the apocalypse, a girl figures out that she has to blow it up....? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I mean a few scenes were pretty cool, but I felt so disconnected from the characters and...what exactly was the plot? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Tbh I didn't enjoy the movie all that much. I felt bored and was expecting something totally different. :/ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Late night showing of Tomorrowland tonight since we didn't get to go yesterday! <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Going to see Tomorrowland tonight with my lovely c: &lt;3 been really excited for this movie since Disneyland. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> How the last scene should have gone: Theon kills Ramsay and he and Sansa run away. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> If you have to use rape as a plot device and even worse USE IT to "make us feel sorry for another character" YOU ARE SCUM <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ Game of Thrones writers and directors, you are sick sick fucks. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm going to get tested for asthma tomorrow because I honestly can't figure out what's causing my breathing problems other than that. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Can't wait to finally play Life is Strange Episode 3 today! Fingers crossed work doesn't call me in. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Aaaaaaand we're back in the fade <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I can't believe I'm trusting my blood Mage ex-friend to help out in this quest. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> But she's in good spirits and staying at a really nice home until she's ready to pass. I'll miss you nonna &lt;3 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Sad news is that I probably saw my grandma for the last time today. Poor woman is nothing but skin and bones. ;____; <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Just hearing those words for the first time made my heart explode and I am just so fucking happy right now <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @chasetestini I'll change the 'Testini' part of my name and username to my middle name if that's okay? :) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chasetestini Daniele--Dan for short. Busch is my mom's last name, but I prefer my dad's. Before Charlie, my name was Cassie. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chasetestini I'm not impersonating you--this is my actual name. Testini is my dad's last name. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chasetestini Haha, small world. I was going to ask you the same question actually. :p <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Look at this adorable little munchkin. http://t.co/HbcAHu1cfm <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> THERES FREE BURGERS ON CAMPUS GLORY HALLELUJAH <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> First day of class a success! Gotta find out where to get my student card and upass now. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm done all my work but the teacher won't give me the second half of the chapter :/ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Why are all math upgrade teachers from Czechoslovakia? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> First day of summer classes today. Hopefully I can get my shift covered tonight so that I can just recover when I get home. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Moms going to the hospital right now. I hope everything's okay ;____; <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Of COURSE I get sick two days before school starts. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ASMR videos are my best friends. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Let it grooooww, let it groowwwww, can't shave it off anymooooooore üé∂ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Now the question of the night is: to shave the scruff or to let it grow? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @soapinthesock CONGRATS BRO! C: <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> B- in both my classes this term. Awe yiss. #gettingbettereveryterm #gottagetthatgpauptho <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Honestly how do you even accomplish that? What's your phone doing under you in the first place? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Cosmopolitan is such a weird magazine. "I butt-dialled my mom mid-orgasm!" Yeah, okay lady. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> HELL HATH NO FURY LIKE MY SCREECH OF RAGE WHEN SOMEONE TEXTS ME WHILE IM PLAYING LOVE LIVE <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I haven't picked up Origins for two weeks. HOW DO YOU PLAY?! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I just sneezed so hard that I threw my phone half way across the room. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Age of Ultron tonight with Brie! I'm just going to ignore all the bad things I've heard about it and go in with an open mind. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> My manager is sending me snapchats of her Han Solo cosplay that she wore to work today <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Can't wait to get back home where there's constant working wifi and Dragon Age. &lt;3 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @soapinthesock oh no! I hope everything's okay! Feel better soon, bro! ;A; <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Last day in California. :( We fly back tomorrow, but the one thing I will definitely not miss is this heat. &gt;.&gt; <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Bacon cheese fries and an m&amp;m milkshake may or may not be the best thing right now. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Also, stop trying to speak for trans people. You are a cis lesbian; you have no right to say what is/isn't transphobic. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> "Ain't nothing wrong with being misgendered. Genders are equally beautiful in their own ways." Literally fuck off, I swear to god. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> She's so fucking transphobic it makes me want to puke. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> How does Arielle even have supporters? How is she considered a major advocate for the LGBT community? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It's 11am; we just woke up and it's already 28 degrees outside. I am going to die. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> My lips are weirdly shaped, my eyes are too bulgy, my nose is too big, my face is too short and round, the list is fucking endless. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm scared there will never be a day when I can say without hesitation that I love myself. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Just breathe, you're going to be fine. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> My self esteem ruins everything tbh. I'm in one of the happiest places on earth, yet I have a breakdown whenever Brie wants a picture w/ me <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> First day of California did not disappoint; can't wait for the first day of Disneyland tomorrow! C: <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Brie and I went to see a magician tonight at a dinner show and he was so fucking funny; Brie is still in stitches. xD <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Oh my god, it's actually colder here than it is back home and it's raining??? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> And besides my bangs needing to grow a little more, I really really like my hair. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> On the plane in 9 hours! Time to sleep! C: <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Literally all I have is one pair of shorts that are too big and five variations of black and white tank tops <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I also just realized that I own zero clothes that would be appropriate for California <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Jbrynelson I WISH YOU WRRE HERE RIGHT NOW BECAUSE IM SOBBING OVER GREYS ANATOMY AND I NEED YOU <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> GREYS ANATOMY YOU DONT GET TO FUCKING DO THIS TO ME DONT FUCKING DO THIS <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Criminal Minds is freaking me the fuck out. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @soapinthesock I'll look into it for sure if I can't renew my Blue Cross. Thanks bro! C: <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @soapinthesock Blue Cross which covers both my brother and I, but apparently my card is old and there's a new one out. :/ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @soapinthesock it used to be only $30 last year ;w; was there a huge jump in price or something? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> $50 for testosterone. Dayyyyyum when did it get so expensive? ;w; <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Fingers crossed my insurance is still in effect to get my new vial of T today. ;w; <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm so tired and I have to leave in ten minutes yet here I am still in bed with no intentions of getting out of it <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ALSO I JUST GOT A RAISE AND A $500 PAYCHEQUE üôèüèª <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The snake/snail meme makes me so angry and I don't know why it's just so fucking annoying and I want it gone <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I just had an idea for an AoKise fic but if I end up writing it I am definitely going to hell O////O <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm gonna have a nice healthy breakf--HOLY SHIT WE HAVE CORN POPS <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Out of T :/ and payday is tomorrow so I can't get any until then. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> So uh, maybe/maybe not going blonde this Thursday before Disneyland??? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> All the boys from EXO can get it tbh hot damn <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> HOLY SHIT DISNEYLAND THIS SATURDAY <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ADAM LAMBERT HAS A NEW CD COMING OUT <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm very tempted to just pull up a word document right now and just write my own. Someone stop me. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> IS THERE ANY FIC ON THIS GOD DAMNED WEBSITE WHERE THERE IS NO "THEIR TONGUES BATTLED FOR DOMINANCE" B/C I S2G IF I READ THAT ONE MORE TIME <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Torn between going to sleep or reading every single aokise fic on ao3 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @soapinthesock FUCK THE FADE <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @soapinthesock oh god. I'm scared bro ;~; circle of magi is probably going to be worse tho <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @soapinthesock all of your live tweeting of origins makes me REAAAAALLLY not want to play it xD <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> So stoked to try out Destiny tonight after work! C: <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @SunshineX0_ and you can watch a couple videos that really quickly go through the storyline of each game. c: <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @SunshineX0_ Ehhh probably not too too much in my opinion--if you care about how characters are linked then maybe, buuuuut... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Imo, the series finale wasn't as epic as what people had chalked it up to be, but nevertheless a solid ending to a great series. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Why is it that I feel fine when I wake up at 6:30, but as soon as 7:00 hits I feel like garbage? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Literally the last thing I said was: "I love you, I'll see you later tonight" when Brie left at 10 this morning. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I just realized I haven't spoken a single word for fourteen hours today. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> And it actually makes me really emotional because I've always had math teachers treat me like I'm stupid for not getting it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> My teacher actually makes me excited to learn math and I've never felt that before. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm really super excited because for my enviro. science class we get to make a scrapbook and mine's going to be so pretty! <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @mack_diddy Yeah, Bowman for sure, but my therapist told me that more doctors will be offering it so it might shorten the wait list. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @Bubbl3z_ Mmhmm, that's awesome to hear! If she can live comfortably, then that's better than being in constant pain from her teeth. :( <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Bubbl3z_ I can't imagine how painful it must be. Does your kitty have a special diet? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DreSawall I'll do some digging and see if one already exists. If we don't like it we can tweak it or make our own. C: <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DreSawall HELL YEAH <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> And I'm fucking sorry for keeping you in the dark and avoiding you but we've been friends for 17 years and I still can't open up to you. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> anxiety that keeps me from leaving the fucking house most days, then maybe yeah, you are better off without me. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I know that I'm a shitty friend, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure that one out, but jfc if you can't handle my social (cont.) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Wow... I can't believe that just happened... I am so fucking upset, I am shaking... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Finally a day off from work. Spending it  cleaning our messy as hell room and writing. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Got my hot chocolate, lots of warm blankets, and my lovely snuggled up next to me. This is the happiest I've been all week. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> GARLIC MASHED POTATOES FOR DINNER CAN I GET A HELL YEAH <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Having to get up to leave when you're all warm and cuddled up is the worst thing in the world. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @ColIegeStudent: I want to get an education but I dont want to wake up early or do homework <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Still as oblivious to flirting as I was back in high school. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The worst part about running into people from high school is that they still know me as female and I'm too nervous to say anything. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Jensen Ackles, your eyes should be against the law. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Or Daniel James... You know I'm kind of diggin' that one right now. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> But all that reminds me of is chocolate so now I'm back to square one. #therehasgottobeanamethatsuitsme <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Mom said that if I were born a biological boy that she would have named me Reese. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Muahahaha, might be an extra in a Captain America movie this Saturday. c: <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Turns out I may have dyscalculia. And here I thought all these years that I was just stupid for not getting math right away. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> If I eat a bowl of ice cream while lifting weights, is that counterproductive? #itprobablyisbutimgonnadoitanyway <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> HOLY DAMN YOU CANNOT END A SEASON LIKE THAT <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Still not over my favourite character's death and last episode's serious dose of secondhand embarrassment. Holy shit. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Gonna marathon OitNB until I pass out. Two episodes to go and then I'm finally caught up. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> God dammit, how much snow do we need on the fucking ground before schools close? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Fingers crossed that they close the school tomorrow because I'm a piece of shit and I didn't write my paper <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Ugh when I buy you expensive things, I kind of expect you to take care of them. -___- <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Late afternoon/evening shifts are the worst things in existence. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Like how am I supposed to dig up new information on Australian Aboriginals and their art that's not already known??? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Why couldn't this assignment be just an essay instead of a six page research proposal? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DreSawall Hopefully D: maybe EB Games down the road can do something... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Off to get my shot and then hopefully I can settle down and get a good chunk of homework done today. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Words cannot explain how excited I am that Poets of the Fall has a new album in the works. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @PoetsOfTheFall: 1st real (meaning not demo) recording day done! The new album is now a couple of drum &amp; bass tracks closer to completio‚Ä¶ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> People at my college are just clumped in groups around the new TV's marathoning Harry Potter and Doctor Who. This is lovely. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I really just want to work or volunteer at a stable. I miss being around horses so much. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DreSawall Even now? D: <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Jbrynelson It's okay, love. Maybe it'll work in the morning. And if not there's a new one that I've had my eyes on for a couple months. :p <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> After a long day of bullshit, it feels good to finally crawl into bed and not think about it anymore. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Jbrynelson If I had rice to put it in. D: <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Welp. Corrupted word files and my 3DS has water damage so the 'A' button won't work. Fan-fucking-tastic. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mack_diddy holy shit did I ever want to unleash all the frustration I had from earlier today on him. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I never should have left my bed this morning. Thank god I'm home. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Bus never came and when I tried to get on the next one I got shoved by this one guy who thought I was budging and called me a fucking faggot <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> out of my backpack and it went right into the ankle high puddle under the bus. Thanks a fucking lot. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I also smell like mud because the bus splashed me and the douchebag who bumped into me while I was getting my wallet dislodged my 3DS (cont) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I am so pissed. Philosophy exams are the most bullshit things I have ever written and my teacher is a horrible marker. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I have so much to do tomorrow, I don't even want to think about it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Jbrynelson yeaaaaaah buddy like all the time <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Guess who won Roll up the Rim today! There covers my morning hot chocolate tomorrow. c: <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Wow I just planned out all of my JeanMarco fic and my god the ending is depressing <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @SunshineX0_ No worries! Yeah they're doing it for their 50th anniversary. I would have missed it too if my classmate didn't show me. D: <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Welp. First hot chocolate down and not a winner. Oh well. Maybe my next two will be the lucky ones. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @SunshineX0_ did you remember to do the bonus roll too? :) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I just want to be able to wear skinny jeans again without people misgendering me please and thank <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Went to school early so that I could grab a breakfast sandwich and now I'm stuck with nothing to do. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm going to have so much hot chocolate today it's not even funny. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I KNEW it before it was even posted that Vic Mignogna would be in the SnK English dub. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @SunshineX0_: #RollUpTheRim is trending, I'm so excited to go to @TimHortons tomorrow morning! :D <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Jbrynelson Mmhmm, and I see it that way too. Parents? Proooobably not so much because they pay for it. :c <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Jbrynelson I've actually spent like half the day frustrated because I'm second guessing my career choices. D: <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> In fact I'm almost certain I don't want to be a teacher anymore and I want to be a flight attendant and get to travel. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm so fucking angry because I don't know if I want to be a teacher anymore. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @SunshineX0_: ROLL UP THE RIM IS BACK TOMORROW I'M SO EXCITED :D <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Ugh why are names so complicated? I can't figure out character names let alone my own name. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Taking Brie to the Pet Lovers show at the tradex this weekend for Valentine's Day. Can't wait! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> No work which means I get to cuddle and watch old people TV with Brie all day. c: <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Trying to get a shift covered at Build a Bear is like pulling teeth. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Stop being jealous Stop being jealous Stop being jealous Stop being jealous Stop being jealous Stop being jealous Stop being jealous <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> 24 hour flu officially beat. Thank god. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I feel like chugging twenty glasses of water. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Jbrynelson You too &lt;3 I think the worst of it is over. I slept nearly all day and managed to eat some crackers. c: <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Non stop puking for four hours. Jfc please can I just keep some water down. I'm so dehydrated. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Holy damn I can't sing half of the songs we used to sing in choir without my throat sounding like it's being ripped in two. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Why is it every time I text and ask if everything is okay then that's when the texts stop coming in... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DreSawall But in all seriousness, flower bros unite. \m/ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DreSawall DO YOURS HAVE LITTLE BIRDS ON THEM AND FLOWERS THAT LITERALLY REPRESENT FEMININITY AND FEMALE SEXUALITY GOD DAMN <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DreSawall You have a dog and a cat though so there's always dander. D: <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> But of course ten thousand "no's" later and here I am still with cherry blossom adorned drapes and blankets. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm 21 I think I can choose what I want in my room and what I don't. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I honestly don't know how mom and Cory make the house so dirty when Brendan and I aren't home half the time. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I guess I should do English homework before I have to vacuum for THE THIRD GOD DAMN TIME THIS WEEK. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I don't know how people can write past midnight. My brain turns into a pile of illiterate mush. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> You will never know how competitive I am until you play jeopardy with me at midnight <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I am so fucking happy right now! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I didn't even feel the needle this time and I don't hurt at all like last time either. Odd, but I'm not complaining. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I NEED THE NEXT CHAPTER OF "LIKE A DRUM" LIKE I NEED OXYGEN <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> All I wanna do is read/write JeanMarco fics, but Anthropology calls... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Class definitely should have started by now. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Holy cats it's windy out this morning. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Fire Emblem: Awakening has taken over my life now good bye <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I am such a horrible texter, jfc. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Apologies to those who I text at midnight because that's the only time I actually remember to reply to messages. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> High score on Flappy Bird: 15 I am actually really proud of myself. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Zero motivation right now to leave my warm bed and stand in the freezing cold for the bus. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I am just so pissed off lately and I have such a low tolerance for fuckwads on the Internet. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Sometimes I just want to delete every single account I have on every social media site. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> First five seconds of Let it Go officially mastered on my keyboard. Holy cats I am a slow learner. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm starving but I have no idea what to make for lunch. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Okay, time to crack down on all the homework I have. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Babe has an interview at the bank this morning at 10:30. Fingers crossed she gets the job. c; <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Jeopardy on the Wii is so hilariously bad; Brie and I are on the floor laughing, jfc. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Flappy Bird is unbelievably frustrating. I can't get past 6. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> How is there still an hour left of class? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I still feel so sick this morning, I think I might stay home from school today... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> That Chinese food did not agree with me... Please just let me sleep this off. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I wish there was more I could do to help my mom. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I am hardcore struggling to keep awake in Philosophy. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @theothertaylore Him for one, but there's someone far worse than him that my brother has gotten me addicted to. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Too scared to leave my room because Cory is going bat shit crazy <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Do you ever watch a tutorial on how to play your favourite song and want to punch a wall because never in a million years could you play it <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> *cars. But cats work as well... I'm still so pissed about that. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> One minute my family is home and then the next both cats are gone and I'm home alone <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Why oh why do people who are literal shit bags have nice music? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I fucked up my high school education so much. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> There's also no forced conversation which is a-okay with me. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The best part of not having any friends in my classes is that I have break time all to myself. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> My family needs to move into a bigger house so we can have an at home gym. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mack_diddy Thanks a bunch! I'll remember that for next time :) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> My muscle where I got injected is so sore that I can't stop laughing. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Guess who's officially on T?! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I probably should have woken up a bit earlier. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> TWO HOURS AND SIXTEEN MINUTES I AM SHAKING <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> My working out is actually paying off. I feel so fucking good right now. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> My brother just said that my shoulders look really good and that is a HUGE confidence boost holy shit <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Anybody care to explain why YouTube is being a little shit? Lookin' at you, Google+. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> HOLY SHIT JUST A LITTLE LESS THAN 16 HOURS <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @Lord_Voldemort7: Those who don't believe in magic will never find it. Also, they suck. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The lesbian couple and their scenes are so awkward though; I always skip them. :/ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The bra budget for this show is $0 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Spending the day watching Queer as Folk and eating m&amp;m's. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I honestly think I need a mental health day today so that exactly what I'm going to do. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> So tonight was certainly...eye opening. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DreSawall He uses the same examples and I just want to spoon my brain out ;3; <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Jbrynelson I don't even think we do tbh :/ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DreSawall But all we've been talking about is probability for two weeks D: <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I feel like we talk about the same thing in Philosophy every class. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @ColIegeStudent: What is it like to not be tired i can‚Äôt remember <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> 8:30am classes should be illegal. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Sorry, not sorry. Move on from the bullshit and appreciate the family you have. Stop being a selfish bitch. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> And that he wouldn't leave the woman he's been with for ten years for you and now you're jealous that he has a better life than you. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Trash talk me all you want mom, but don't you ever insult my dad in front of my face. You're just bitter because he didn't want you back. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @vettexl WERE YOU INVOLVED WITH THE "POKEMON PAPER" THING THAT DUNCAN MADE UP AND WE MADE AN ELITE FOUR WITH SIDEWALK CHALK <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> My last retweet is exactly how Brie and I got together, omfg. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @ColIegeStudent: My version of flirting is looking at someone I find attractive multiple times and hoping they're more brave than I am <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Agsdhshdjdh what the hell am I supposed to do for two hours? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Note to self: get in classes next semester that don't have huge time gaps in between them. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @vettexl Did it take you back to the days when we hung out on the couch in my driveway and traded cards out of Duncan's car trunk? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Well shit, looks like I should get ready for class. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> My dad made a speech about unconditional love to me today and after that I STILL chickened out about telling him. #dammit <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> So since Dad bailed on me yesterday (no surprise there) we're hanging out today. c: <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Normally I don't mind rowdy people, but I felt so uneasy around them that we just decided to leave. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Left the game after the second period. The people beside us were rude and drunk as fuck. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Off to the game c: <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @rainbowjordii comes home tomorrow! I am so excited! &lt;3 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Vancouver Canucks game with Brie tonight. c: <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> There is no better feeling in the world than a refreshing shower, clean sheets, and falling asleep next to the person you love. #goodday <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mack_diddy I'll definitely give it a try :) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Jbrynelson yup. I can handle 10:30 though. Getting up at 6:30am just to catch the bus isn't worth it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mack_diddy I'm actually considering it. Is it hard to commit to? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Next semester, I need to remind myself that 8:30am classes are not my forte and I should not take them. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I honestly never want to eat another animal again. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I just watched a documentary on how humans treat animals and I feel so sick to my stomach right now. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Of course I can't get upset when they do because they don't know but I'll definitely have to email them tonight. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I don't know what's worse. When they misgender me altogether or when they correct themselves after saying "sir". <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I forgot to email my waitlist class teachers when I got accepted into the class. Argh. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @theothertaylore: I just heard a guy tell his 3 year old daughter "No, sweetie. Lady Gaga didn't make your lunch.. Mommy did." #priceless <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Time to finally catch up on Sherlock. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Why am I making flaking out on a virtual unicorn such a big deal? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I just realized I was supposed to meet Julian this morning and I didn't and now I feel bad. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Too many Charmander's in the Wonder Trade system, ugh. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> My Anthropology teacher plays old rock music during the break and it's awesome. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Because you know speaking in a monotonous voice makes the origins of Anthropology so much more interesting. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mack_diddy I am so jealous of you right now. Please take lots of pictures. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @TheIlluminati: Take time each day to recognize and connect with the things that that make you grateful and keep you humble. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I got Brie addicted to Skyrim and it is the absolute best watching her figure it out without my help. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @rainbowjordii I can't wait to hear all about it and to give you your gift. c: <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @rainbowjordii D: the last thing I got was about your aunt doing hair. Text me when you get back, okay? &lt;3 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @rainbowjordii Bby you never told me you were going to Amsterdam D: <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I miss @rainbowjordii with a fiery burning passion. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Then he wrote dog and proceeded to sniff it and said that it didn't smell like one. It was great. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> He was talking about symbols and he wrote cat on the board, then put his ear up to it and said he couldn't hear it purring. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I forgot to tweet this last night, but I think my Anthropology teacher might be losing it. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> I love my professors this year. My Philosophy teacher looks like a chubby Jesus. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> My knee keeps having these strange pains lately and I have no idea why and I have to stop walking altogether because it hurts so bad. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Why did I sign up for a morning class when I know I can never wake up early enough to make the 7:00am bus? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I made the horrible mistake of reading Twist and Shout before bed and now I am a puddle of emotion. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Finally home from school. I forgot what six hour school days felt like. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @rainbowjordii Holy shit, same thing happened to me today at Subway. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Good lawd, my Anthro teacher looks like Sir Ian McKellen and sounds like Eeyore from Winnie the Pooh. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It took me honestly 10 minutes I find my Anthropology classroom <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> So Michael and Abigail in my English class are freakin' awesome and I love them. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Ah, nothing like that good ol' silence in the classroom when no one knows each other. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> When am I going to be able to find a pair of jeans that actually make me feel good about myself? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Shit, abort mission, abort mission. My hips look fucking huge today, jfc <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mack_diddy Pull 'em aside before class starts or just shoot them off an email if you can. :) <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> So I managed to make my entire family mad at me and I spent three hours crying. Happy fucking new year. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Five people get angry at each other, two people end up crying, three leave early, and the night ends up a disaster. That's how it always is. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> You'd think after five years of failed New Years celebrations that I would be able to choose who I want to spend it with. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @Bubbl3z_ It's not my choice, I fought for five hours last night to let them stay... Cory's asthma can't take it any more... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Bubbl3z_ EXACTLY. Or when people say "calm down" or "get over it". That last one REAAAALLY pisses me off. :/ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> If Michelle can't take my cats, I'm going to need to rehome all of them. Would anyone be willing to take in one of them if things fail? :c <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Bubbl3z_ I know, it sucks so much, and nobody understands what you ever mean by "mental health day." :c <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Babe surprised me with a "Pre-Father's Day" gift and I am crying so hard. I love her so much. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Maybe it's because everyone I have ever seen in public wearing them always has their ass sticking out at the bottom <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Maybe it's just me, but I really don't understand the purpose of high waisted shorts <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Off work an hour and a half early. Time to buy babe's anniversary present and head off to my grandmas BBQ. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Bubbl3z_ that's where I saw it haha! I laughed so hard that I had to adopt it into my vocabulary xD <Text_End>
