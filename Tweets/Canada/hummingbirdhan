<Text_Begin> @Tronndabon @KayRosie i dont like spooky or spoopy. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KayRosie look one day of halloween is fine but an entire month is too much. overshadows thanksgiving, autumn in general. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KayRosie rude. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KayRosie 🚫🎃 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ikonicmark im not into spooky or scary stuff at all and a month of it is way too much.. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ikonicmark halloween can leave now pls <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> i have made the terrible miatake of going to a waiting room with less than 50% battery. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @lovablesivan okay but im gonna eat first. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @lovablesivan idk. i fell off the bed the other day and my foot has hurt since and now its swollen and im limping? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @lovablesivan ow. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> i think i broke my toe while jumping on the bed.... <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @ikonicmark salted licorice, right? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @sweatersivan you ASKED for cute things. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Tronndabon she stopped replying im concerned i may have really killed her. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RIP Lauren. 
Cause of Death: our dm's. 

i am sorry. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @conconsivan im disappointed in me too! sleeping in oversized tshirts is WAY better than sleeping in whatever clothes I'm wearing. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> its 5:20 am and i haven't fallen asleep yet <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> how has it taken me three months to start stealing jordan's clothes. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @musicaltroye heartshakesivan <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ok i gotta go wash dishes and show my suite. bye clem. be patient. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @clememetine @conconsivan public policy and business admin. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @clememetine @conconsivan the law program here is specifically to become a lawyer. thats why we have undergrad degrees like poli sci and <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @conconsivan @clememetine thats true;depending on the college. we get a lot of public funding. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @clememetine @conconsivan we have loans to help. but when i graduate, I'll have about $50,000 of student debt. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @conconsivan @clememetine same here. except.. law is only 2 years now. if you have exceptional marks. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @clememetine @conconsivan there are student fees, accomodation,food, etc. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @clememetine @conconsivan well its extremely expensive here. jordans law program is 16,000 just for tuition. at least 1000 on books, then <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @clememetine @conconsivan yeah. and programs like law or medicine or education require non direct entry; you gotta 2+ years of uni before. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @clememetine @conconsivan like nursing or teaching or kinesiology. otherwise its "arts and sciences" or "engineering" or "business" college. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @clememetine @conconsivan and here we apply for a college within the uni and then declare a major later. unless its a professional program <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @clememetine @conconsivan there is no limit here, but each school has an application fee, so thats a limitation for lots of people <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KayRosie between my father, my boyfriend, and my professors, I'm kind of punned out. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @conconsivan @clememetine rolling admissions are common here too. its an incentive to apply early.. and they hand out scholarships sooner. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @musicaltroye @lovablesivan yeah. we talked about it in my gender studies class. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @musicaltroye @lovablesivan it had faded in use with the stereotyping and criminalisation of gay men. but Hitler made it much worse. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @IzzyMakesArt ..what do you do? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> im just sitting here thinking about little mundane things, because its all their little pieces that make the puzzle fit together best. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> who makes the phone call when they order in food? who forgets to charge their phone nearly every day? who waters the plants? who snores? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> who talks in their sleep and makes the other giggle as they drift off? who turns the lights off every night? who washes dishes? who dries? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> who do you think makes the coffee in the morning? who presses snooze and has to be woken with tickles and kisses? who hogs the blankets? <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> interspersing my movie soundtrack playliat with Beyoncé's feminist songs to remind me that im supposed to be reading gender studies. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> have i mentioned lately how lucky i feel? ✨ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Tronndabon im listening to movie soundtracks while i study. its a spotify study playlist. got distracted by the LOTR one though... too good <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @frantaflowies melancholy too sometimes, and a little vague, but beautiful and stark and idk. i like it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @frantaflowies i think this represented troye so well <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Tronndabon that just seems impractical for everyday use. and risqué to present and put on at the end of the wedding ceremony. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @IzzyMakesArt i kinda love it. its like my way of...summoning the people i love? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Tronndabon omg toe rings. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @IzzyMakesArt i mean, its culturally integrated now, but its the fear of association with homosexuality that started the trend. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> today i learned: men started wearing wedding rings to make it clear they were involved with a woman and fend off rumours of homosexuality. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> jordan &amp; i decided since we arent getting any work done apart, maybe we'd study better together; he's coming here. good plan? probably not. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> harmony's cute tweets make me feel all fuzzy and warm. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @KayRosie im gonna ignore the part where I'm a second right back up plan and skip to YAY🎉 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KayRosie I called you rude and you stopped talking to you so i apologised by tweeting every word seperately &amp; annoyed you into forgiving me <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @IzzyMakesArt The Quiet is sad; that's not moment ruining? <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @Tronndabon @tronnorisbae I'm giving info! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Tronndabon @tronnorisbae its not actually. parchment is made from animal skin. usually vellum. like a calf. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @aaronlivesys text mostly. he's a 10 minute drive away; if we have time to skype we can see each other. but it does feel like forever. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @aaronlivesys uh. no. because he will have practicums. also im in school and i work fulltime. its a mess. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KayRosie okay but. its a tiny version of a bigger thing. its inherently good. like mini bananas or kittens or mini marshmallows. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @aaronlivesys he is in year one. its a four year program... he literally just started. but the course load is super heavy first year. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @conconsivan hannah and i were talking about how you were going to die when you came online. glad to see we know you well.b <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @conconsivan @TroyesCoolShit um thats a lot. go mom. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @aaronlivesys i wouldnt talk about him so much if i actually got to SEE him. dumb law school. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @conconsivan no comment? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @aaronlivesys oh. well. okay. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @aaronlivesys uggh but he's like 90% of what i think about right now i cant help it!! im not meaning to talk about him all the time. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KayRosie what. what. friendship over. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @aaronlivesys oh fuck off i thought we'd all forgotten about this. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @tronnorswift of course you can. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KayRosie I think we are. also don't eat brussel sprouts upside down. im choking on a tiny cabbage. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KayRosie my textbook is SO BORING and my boyfriend is SO BUSY and i am SO BROKE. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KayRosie im going insane, possibly. laying on the floor with my feet on the bed singing to ed sheeran eating brussel sprouts. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KayRosie no kayleigh. im really really not. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @tronnorswift worse short term or long term? its going to be difficult, so the best you can do is make the choice thats seems wisest overall <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @tronnorswift happier? will you be a person you can be comfortable with? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @tronnorswift but ignoring it has made you unhappy with who you are right?so however hard confronting it is, in the long run, will you be <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @tronnorswift so what do you think is the right thing to do? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @sabryvassao and troye increasingly looks like he's coming onto the camera. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @tronnorswift i just dont want you to feel alone. and i love you. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @tronnorswift then dont. let it sit. think on it and wait. not taking immediate action isnt the same as ignoring your problems. give it time <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @sabryvassao connors eyes get smaller the more he drinks. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @tronnorswift or dont do will end the world. mistakes are allowed. expected. and you wont be alone in any of it. that i can promise you. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @tronnorswift find that as you do that, the big and scary and impossible things start to look smaller. and also, remember, nothing you do <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @tronnorswift so maybe... deal with what you have strength and energy for first. deal with the little things and easy things. maybe you'll <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @tronnorswift okay. but will they just go away? because maybe. but for most things, sadly, that isnt actually an option. cant change that. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @cleanyearssivan you've quoted my tweet to a bunch of people and i feel like you are spreading the goodness of hannah and ingrid bless you <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @tronnorswift I've felt like that on and off (mostly on) for ages. but when you have little successes, little victories, you get reenergised <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @tronnorswift then pick one thing to get done or deal with. piece by piece. and its absolutely okay to feel like things are falling apart. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @tronnorswift things that are causing stress, the more they will build up. until it seems impossible. so calm down, take some time, and <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @tronnorswift so do it. but give yourself a limit. 1 hour of quiet nothing time, and then get something done. because the more you avoid the <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @tronnorswift something else you can focus or throw yourself into to keep occupied and help stay sane. coursework or plans or something? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @tronnorswift okay love but you cant change those results now. so when monday comes, you'll deal with that. for now, for the weekend, find <Text_End>
