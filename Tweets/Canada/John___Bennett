<Text_Begin> @AmandaGosio if you can't see.. The original tweet was about the feminist using them as an example of rape.. I was merely pointing out <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> And the people making the jokes are ignorant.. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @John___Bennett for point of reference on what I was talking about anyways, look at the whole quote of the tweet.. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Holyfuckingshit everyone just reply here if you want to hate on my choice to defend the right of speech and opposition of extreme feminism <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AmandaGosio ...I didn't retweet their retweets.. My retweet was about the feminists who used them as poster boys for rape education.. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @anitazamanii I'm not saying they should I'm saying you're not going to stop all of them but you can't take jokes and use them as posterboys <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AmandaGosio I know they are I'm not saying they're not but if you look at the actually tweet you'll see what all this is actually about.. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @anitazamanii that's what being politically correct is.. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AmandaGosio I'm not saying you, I'm saying society.. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AmandaGosio we are decent human beings but just because of that you can't dismiss their opinions and use them as excuses for what happens <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @BlakeHarris18 @SpencerAnnB they can say them if they want to though they have freedom of speech which is what I'm saying <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> People are honestly way too politically correct these days.. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AmandaGosio @BlakeHarris18 @SpencerAnnB they're always going to be making jokes you need to accept it and stop using them as excuses <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @BlakeHarris18 @SpencerAnnB I don't know you tell me but personally the jokes go against my morals but you can't dismiss them <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @maxmanglallan @AmandaGosio @BlakeHarris18 @SpencerAnnB because you can't use them as the reason for all of the anti rape themes <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @BlakeHarris18 @SpencerAnnB there's no reason to kill himself.. There are already resources available and people you can talk to.. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AmandaGosio @BlakeHarris18 @SpencerAnnB just because they hurt someone else doesn't mean they have to stop or are wrong, politically, maybe <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AmandaGosio @BlakeHarris18 @SpencerAnnB I'm saying that you need to call down for the reason you just said <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @BlakeHarris18 @SpencerAnnB yes but he can get through it himself and he'll grow stronger as a person <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @BlakeHarris18 @SpencerAnnB no? People did and I didn't care.. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @BlakeHarris18 @SpencerAnnB if no one wants to hear them then ignore them.. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @BlakeHarris18 @SpencerAnnB yeah? If an alien called you human would you be offended by that too? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @BlakeHarris18 @SpencerAnnB I know who I am so I don't care what they think or say <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @BlakeHarris18 @SpencerAnnB then take it like a normal person? People have called me gay constantly and I ignored them nothing wrong with it <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @BlakeHarris18 @SpencerAnnB but if you're strong enough to know what you are then just accept it it's just a word just know who you are <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @BlakeHarris18 @SpencerAnnB if they call you a fag and you are.. I would own it? If you are what they're calling you there's nothing wrong <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @BlakeHarris18 that's cool all I'm saying is that they're making a joke not being serious so people should stop using them as examples <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @BlakeHarris18 @SpencerAnnB well maybe people should learn how to be themselves then there wouldn't be problems like this <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @BlakeHarris18 I wasn't making any offensive jokes.. just saying to leave these guys alone.. There's too much political correctness <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @BlakeHarris18 @SpencerAnnB why not? If you know who you are you know who you are people need to soften up and start caring less on opinions <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @BlakeHarris18 @SpencerAnnB I honestly wouldn't care.. Same way I used to be depressed but idc about jokes about depression <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @BlakeHarris18 @SpencerAnnB no it really doesn't.. I could make jokes about it all I want and it wouldn't belittle it's importance <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @BlakeHarris18 @SpencerAnnB I don't support it I'm not supporting it I'm just saying it's a joke about how feminists take things overboard <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @BlakeHarris18 @SpencerAnnB I didn't say it was funny I'm saying people on overreact to them just like you guys are right now <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @SpencerAnnB yes because have you been hurt by the joke no.. Have I been personally hurt by the joke? No.. Therefore it doesn't hurt.. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @maxmanglallan @aImightygrl well I don't really care what I seem like if guys want to make jokes about it then be my guest it doesn't hurt <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @angesuppa @aImightygrl it is warped I agree and there is no real reason other than to mock some of the things feminists say but they can <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @angesuppa @aImightygrl no..That is sarcasm that's a fact whether we choose to believe it and it is ok to say that..To enact it is different <Text_End>
