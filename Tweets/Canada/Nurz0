<Text_Begin> @Scott_PanterA @lJoSquaredl cancelled cause you suck <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GH057ayame wing now for BR start and having a kill time of 1.43 will make the gameplay a lot more exciting imo. Up to you in the end though <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GH057ayame I think making a drastic change to a 5 loadout again would just divide people over settings again. We have a strong enough follo <Text_End>
