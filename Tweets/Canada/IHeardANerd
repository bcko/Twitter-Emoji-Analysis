<Text_Begin> My son eats almost exclusively chicken. Tonight, I told him he needs something different, so I was going to make him eggs.

<Text_Begin> @RoosterTeeth And I thought it was bad what happened to Yang! Then I realized this. Why do you want to hurt us so? https://t.co/bT8XPUHiVu <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> I'm just a soul whose intentions are good.

Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Edwinhmc Or, even better, some high-class ass. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> 5yo begged me to read her a particular book. Literally one sentence in, she proclaimed, "I'm bored," and ran off to play.

Children are fun. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> If you've been waiting for a sign...

This is it! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Starting a workout regimen at the gym today!

Wait, membership is $65/month?

Hmmm.

Starting a workout regimen at home today! <Text_End>

After: look just like everyone else. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @BaroniDomenica @tassieluke WOW!!!!! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Pro: someone on the train thought I was attractive.

Con: I'm not gay. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KittyAngel1617 Fair enough. Now I know. ;-) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Can't decide which is worse: 13-year-olds who look like they're 18, or 18-year-olds who look like they're 13. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Everyone says, "There's plenty of fish in the sea." So what? I don't want to have sex with a fish! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> There are three kinds of people:
1) People who love #RWBY
2) People who would love #RWBY if they'd heard of it
3) People who are wrong <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ahullum Thank you! Someone had to say it! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I hate seeing "Employees must wash hands" signs. I'm uncomfortable eating anywhere that the staff need to be reminded to wash after a shit. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> That moment when the store is closed, but you pull on the door anyway.

&amp; when it's locked, you yell to the people inside, "Are you closed?" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Man, before smartphones, people actually had to talk to the people they were physically with. Could you imagine? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> $42 to park the car until Sunday? BC Ferries has one hell of a scam going! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Wife just made this observation:

"Surprise Egg videos are like porn for kids." <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> If you own a junkyard, I think it's a missed opportunity if you don't call it, "The scrappiest place on Earth." <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KittyAngel1617 Oh. Definitely! I love to talk, and share my views, and learn things from other people! I think that's why we're here! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KittyAngel1617 Hmmm? Seriously what? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> So... I'm up. Who wants to chat? Message me, I'm up for talking about anything, from the most inconsequential to the deepest thoughts. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Wife just texted me: "Will you make sure the family room is clean? Because Judaism."

I'm not entirely sure how to respond to that. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Nothing tastes as good as skinny feels.

Except cake. And pizza. And bacon. And milkshakes. And Pepsi. And sour candy. And chocolate. And... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KittyAngel1617 Me too! One of the most well-made cartoons I've ever seen! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Burnt_Out_Darth This isn't the nap you're looking for. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @hubsnnewhotwife @verywhales Hard to tell how attractive she is. This is like trying to judge a movie based on seeing half of it. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @Kirino_ZR1 How's that for confusing? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Kirino_ZR1 I before E, except after C, or when sounded in "Ay", as in Neighbour or Weigh, or in words like Fiery or Rottweiler, and so on. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Kirino_ZR1 English is hard if you don't grow up with it. There are exceptions to every single rule of spelling and grammar. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Love is more powerful than hate, fear, indifference. Love is always the answer. No matter what you face, never stop loving. #LoveEveryDay <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Kirino_ZR1 I get that. I studied Mandarin Chinese in University, and that was horribly complicated. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Kirino_ZR1 No problem, you speak English much better than I speak Japanese! ;-) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Kirino_ZR1 It's a tie. Although there's not one character I don't like, my favourites are Jaune &amp; Nora. Jaune's sweet, &amp; Nora's hilarious. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @Kirino_ZR1 Thank you! I'm proud of all of them, but the RWBY one is by far my favourite! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The doctor said she has PTSD, PPD, PPA, and OCD.

Someone had alphabet soup for lunch today... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> If you think there's nothing you can do to help the victims of terrorism: I urge you to donate blood. It costs nothing, and may save a life! <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @GovernorBentley You can refuse refugees so as to avoid "letting the terrorists win." But by giving in to fear, you ARE letting them win. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Countries are refusing refugees in order to avoid "letting the terrorists win." Giving in to fear means you're letting the terrorists win. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @RoosterTeeth Keep hearing Yang from the first episode: "Aren't you excited?" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Choosing between Clinton an Trump is like choosing between arsenic or cyanide. True, you have a choice, but either way is terrible. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @realDonaldTrump Perhaps for the same reason that, were the terrorists Christian, he wouldn't use the term Christian terrorism? <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Favorite #RWBY characters:
Mine: tie - Jaune/Nora
5yo: Ruby
3yo: Penny
S/O: Doesn't watch, for reasons beyond my comprehension. <Text_End>

Sit still for &gt;5 seconds
Avoid using furniture as gymnastic equipment
Express any thought without shouting <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @neiltyson I feel your pain. This is exactly why my wife won't watch movies with me anymore. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It's a sad reflection on our world that killing someone, even a terrorist like #JihadiJohn, is something to brag about. <Text_End>

3,400: Americans who died by household Firearms since five weeks ago. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> In The Hunger Games, they kept Peeta alive to help them find Katniss. Once they had her in a tree, why did none of them bother to kill him? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Burnt_Out_Darth We're following Darth Vader. Any light-siders are either deeply confused, or your son. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @ireland_sam Checked out RWBY Vol 1 on Netflix. I liked the opening scene, but I've been hooked since Nora's first scene! Keep it up!!! XD <Text_End>
