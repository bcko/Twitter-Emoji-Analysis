<Text_Begin> @Mike_Cluett How about this out of the box idea: Have a sign with all applicable candidates on it, placed throughout town. No sign wars! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mike_Cluett and I'm happy for that, since you've been a great Councillor for Milton! I just can't see everyone behaving themselves. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mike_Cluett I don't want the ban either, but it's kind of like dealing with children.  You can't give them complex rules and expect results <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mike_Cluett with social media and door knocking, I don't think the sign game is as much of a factor as people think. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mike_Cluett fines won't change behaviour, as people don't worry about getting "caught".  Just ban them, so there is no grey area. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mike_Cluett that only works when everyone goes along with it.  It only takes one candidate to flood a street and then all hell breaks lose. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @giampierod Probably one of the worst movies I've seen in a while.  I didn't pay to see it, but I want my ~2 hours back! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @giampierod haha, I bet.  We should hook up again and let the rug rats make us laugh. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @giampierod Capt Unimpressed is kind of in hiatus anyway.  My daughter impresses me no a daily basis ... how's Darth? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @giampierod Capt Unimpressed says "meh" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @giampierod Makes sense, though I believe you can get a USB IR device from logitech and then use media center ... but then why not WDLTV+? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @giampierod We don't use the keyboard very often, mostly the mouse.  I grabbed one of these for when it's necessary: http://t.co/ecevO1L <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @giampierod It was pretty solid, hooks up with any DNLA devices.  Less proprietary then Apple, but then that was never and issue for you. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @giampierod I tried the WD Live plus, but ended up taking it back because Amanda didn't like it as much as using the PC hooked up to the TV. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @giampierod Perhaps.  Still too early to say imo. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @giampierod I doubt that.  They'll just have to pay a tax and keep on trucking.  Android is too big to stop now. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @giampierod Crying with press releases or crying with lawyers ... the only difference is one is 'free'. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @giampierod Patent litigation for software is ridiculous anyway.  Everyone steals off of everyone, and only sue when they feel threatened... <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @giampierod http://t.co/xg4BVDx :D ... though no keyboard tray is kind of ass, to be honest I haven't seen a nice desk for myself in years. <Text_End>
