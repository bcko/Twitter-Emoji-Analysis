<Text_Begin> @SweetieAshe @TanukiMaki Yeah, as DM you can use those to change how things happen or have little things in there that might be of interest. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @SweetieAshe @TanukiMaki but the idea behind constructing the flow of a campaign hasnt changed <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @SweetieAshe @TanukiMaki The purchasable campaigns have good examples of how this works as well, though I only have some for 4th ed. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @SweetieAshe @TanukiMaki Pretty much avoid forcing players to do things, and be ready to improvise a way to keep the campaign winnable. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @SweetieAshe @TanukiMaki And sometimes not - if they had advice, a key or something maybe now players undertake a more difficult path. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @SweetieAshe @TanukiMaki --from an encounter with monsters or meet them in the woods or something. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @SweetieAshe @TanukiMaki --ways. Have the person be in the tavern, but if the players don't encounter them then, maybe they rescue them-- <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @SweetieAshe @TanukiMaki Players usually decide what to do so you set out your campaign so that they can meet important people in multiple-- <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @SweetieAshe @TanukiMaki You go with the flow. if a member dies and they reroll you build an encounter. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @SweetieAshe @TanukiMaki the human brain behind the 'rng' of the game is what makes it great. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @SweetieAshe @TanukiMaki with tabletop, rules are very easy to bend and break to suit your group. Not hard and fast like video games <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @SweetieAshe @TanukiMaki or maybe have a survivor exist to either lead a new set of characters or to go back and revive everyone <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @SweetieAshe @TanukiMaki --unless thats the sort of group your players are. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @SweetieAshe @TanukiMaki but remember your aim is a good campaign, if it just kills the party it may not be serving that purpose-- <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @SweetieAshe @TanukiMaki yeah, sometimes you help or hurt if theyve got a string of real awful or real good luck. not something to do often <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @SweetieAshe @TanukiMaki Well, sometimes DMs do it to keep the campaign going <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Nobody was all pissed off or even gave half a shit about backwards compatibility for PS2 on PS4 before they announced this stuff. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Just sounds like a lot of "I wanted you to do a different thing and i'm madder than if you'd done nothing at all" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I just don't think Sony's the evil empire for selling PS2 games on PS4 tbh. Nobody's holding a gun to your head and forcing you to buy. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Rogue Galaxy topped my list, so i'm definitely grabbing that. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm behind this PS2 on PS4 thing but only if it's delivering actual good deals on games I dont already have on PS2 or PS3. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @TanukiMaki @starryclovers But sadly most media these days is selling ads first and news second. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @HonooNoFukai they lumped it in with mobile games <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @HonooNoFukai Yeah, I back a lot less than I did. (mighty no. 9 is when I stopped so dodged that one) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @realfatapollo they should ticket all those morons running across the bloody 111 instead <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @HonooNoFukai though, I never actually played Spacebase. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @HonooNoFukai but nostalgia has been a key to peoples wallets for a while, both by pubs and crowdfunds <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @HonooNoFukai I'm kind of indifferent, and tbh why bother backing something that'll probably be sure of funding anyway <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @HonooNoFukai but how much does that even matter, if you're not backing it? Buy it if its good etc. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @HonooNoFukai I just don't get the hate beyond not backing because most of the people doing it hate double fine regardless. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @Altrius_ @starpendle All I can say is it works for me. UI is personal preference. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @jjasonf @DarkHeroMind @Altrius_ the fault of a) Blu-Ray has a piss poor transfer rate and b) both consoles have a piddly 5400rpm drive <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @Sobou thats 90% of my health D: <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Not sure if that's with AMD's new Crimson drivers which form what i've seen are completely broken anyway. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @DarkHeroMind @rajanagastail @Kamiwoo the game kinda gives them to you gradually so its not overwhelming. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DarkHeroMind @rajanagastail @Kamiwoo usually you get like 1 or 2 spammable abilities and one big damage one on a slower cooldown <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DarkHeroMind @rajanagastail @Kamiwoo I havent played in ages (i'm a spoony bard tho) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @rajanagastail @DarkHeroMind @Kamiwoo years of WoW made me learn but if you're better with it the controller hotbar has plenty of slots :) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DarkHeroMind @rajanagastail @Kamiwoo in XIV? the controller options are pretty good. Best of any MMO. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Rukishou Evolve did do one thing right that everyone needs to learn - don't lock maps behind DLC because it splits your matchmaking pool. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Rukishou Evolve shouldve been F2P with a LoL model honestly. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @thrallia Pretty much. <Text_End>
