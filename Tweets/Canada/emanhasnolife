<Text_Begin> @yasmin_chahine you don't tell the police what to do though? you just call them and inform them. they do the rest <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @yasmin_chahine But like, the guy who abused his cat deserves to be fined and possibly sentenced, why should his school be involved <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @yasmin_chahine depending on the incident of course. but you can always block and move on, people just love to overreact <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @yasmin_chahine plus they deal with the matter in a legally acceptable way <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @yasmin_chahine No, because the police don't post your personal information nor do they contact your school or work <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @yasmin_chahine interesting perspective but I still think police should be contacted before school/work <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @yasmin_chahine right, but why do people jump to taking matters into their own hands before informing the police? like who are u <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @yasmin_chahine obvi but we all know schools dont teach morals, and I know which is why it's up to police to decide <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @yasmin_chahine or send them to jail all they're gonna do is expell them but the individual is still gonna be a prick? so it does nothing <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @yasmin_chahine The parents are responsible for educating their children...plus why are we acting like schools can fine people <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @yasmin_chahine They don't contact the police, they contact the school. Wtf does the school have to do with it <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @yasmin_chahine I agree with you on that but I still think authority should be the one to decide what their consequences are <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Do you think people who tweet dumb shit should have their school/work contacted and be fired/expelled? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @yasmin_chahine That still doesn't give random twitter users the right to ruin someone else's life bc of what they post <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @yasmin_chahine I didn't say people don't deserve to be punished for their actions I said unqualified people shouldn't be the ones punishing <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> You're not qualified or in any position to punish random strangers on the internet by getting them expelled/fired bc of their tweets <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> If someone tweets something racist or offensive block them, why tf you contacting their schools and work you think God dont see what they do <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> why does everyone on twitter love playing God? who gave you the right to decide the consequences for other people's personal choices? <Text_End>
