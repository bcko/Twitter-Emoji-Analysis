<Text_Begin> @daniecal i think part of this was a Girl Issue, too. we're kinda socialized to center romantic relationships w men above all else. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @daniecal there's the good words for it lol. so ppl who go against think we're being ~progressive~ and better. not monogamy's fault rly. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @daniecal it's more like a patriarchy/compulsory heterosexuality thing, i guess. the focus on m/f het marriage as only ~valid~ option. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @daniecal i think our kinda cultural interpretation of monogamy is restrictive. the whole 'marriage is the be-all end-all' thing. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @daniecal like you said-  assumption that poly is better than monogamy bc 'progressive' is arrogant. better for ME, not better overall. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @daniecal wound up not balancing properly w my friendships, stuff like that - but that was a ME problem, not a 'monogamy' problem <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @daniecal oh for sure! i've run into problems w monogamy where it's assumed 1 should be all you need and wound up fucked up abt i i guess. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> but... i guess i can see, a bit, where one might go the other way. might insist on maintaining self-image by imagining adversity. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> i feel that i don't deserve the advantages i have, and thus need to work to make sure others have equal access to the things that i've had <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> i actually get that feeling all the time. 'w privilege, i had nothing to fight, i am weak bc i never had to overcome.' <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> maybe that's it. counter-culture radical activists are often held up as idols in those circles, but they lack the same causes to fight <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @thewayoftheid how did he write that last paragraph straight-faced after admitting he ignored not only a black guy but his agent AND lawyer? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> again, this applies to pretty much all privilege, i think. assuming you earned+deserve advantages your status handed you as a gift. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @nataliereed84 many of those forced into poverty may BE vibrant and kind... but that's a feature of people, not poverty. :/ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> that pride is what you base your self-worth on, in such an individualist/capitalist culture. much reason to resist the revelation. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Perhaps recognition of racism takes away that feeling of pride at overcoming obstacles by showing you how few you really had. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I often see elements of joy+solidarity in Black communities that is just not present w/ white ppl. I feel no pride in inclusion w/whiteness. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> source of jealousy of Blackness, perhaps? we celebrate defeating adversity. where is our adversity? where is our struggle to be proud of? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> you've gotta come to terms with being the end result of generations of colonialist destruction and violence. that's the legacy we receive. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> so we've gotta re-jig our perception of the whole world, not just selves. not only are YOU kind of a dick, but like, all of your heritage. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> managed to collectively forget and ignore the deliberateness with which we've constructed our reality to suit our self-image <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> we have placed ourselves in power and then made that power seem so normal we don't realize we, yknow, TOOK it. not earned it individually. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> further thinks: prevalence of whiteness as authority+majority in all areas leads to belief that this is The Natural Order Of Things <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> long story short: white people's self-esteem is powered by racism and we're all a bunch of whiny shits about it <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Lets us continue seeing world as Hard, But Fair instead of Massively Skewed In Your Favor At Everyone Else's Expense. true of all privilege. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Believing that allows dismissal of systemic advantage/disadvantage as an issue of personal value rather than generations of deck-stacking. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> World as an equal playing field is more comfortable. "I'm way up here bc I'm BETTER. You just didn't work hard enough." Myth of merit. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> We perceive our lives, accomplishments, as hard work. Suggestions that privilege gave us our opportunities becomes an attack on self-worth <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It casts all your accomplishments into question. Did I really work for this? Or was it just handed to me? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Recognizing the realities of racism means recasting whiteness. Not only are we not the heroes  - we’re straight-up the villains <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I think a lot abt where exactly white ppl’s resentment of discussion abt racism comes from, and what it means as a white person <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I say, absorbed in my phone while everyone else is conversing <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> holy shit I'm actually, like, socializing with coworkers at lunch, what <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @mxbees hm. nostalgia=oft false impression of past being better than future. perhaps they blame tech for current less-cheery circumstances. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mxbees maybe it's being forced to (clumsily) pick up new tools. assume their trouble integrating it into their lives = it's not as good? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mxbees always wondered where that comes from. 'we got by without it so you should too'? or is it easier for those who grow up w/ new stuff? <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @xoyenn I just like the idea of sex/nudity being so normalized we don't worry abt judgement for how we express. Thx for the discussion! (: <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Alli_LameLace and thus, the difficulty whenever someone you don't know well complains about radical feminists. me? or the actual radfems? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Alli_LameLace everyone thinks 'radical feminist' just means super intense feminist and i'm like nah man that'd just be criticizing myself <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @xoyenn -just bc it's on you and not a man - that's part of feminism too, i think. obvs not a priority for everyone, but... I get it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @xoyenn + i think for some it's deeply personal. the right to feel sexy in your not 'ideal' body, the right to not have your nip sexualized- <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @xoyenn ooh i see. IMO nudity for women is often political. it has to be bc of the judgements ppl make regardless of reasons i guess <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @xoyenn i totally get why some want to. you might not, but that doesn't make the choice wrong, yknow? there is no wrong answer IMO. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @xoyenn and that's a choice! i've never shared a nude on SM bc i'm not comfy with it. but it's YOUR choice, and MY choice, and THEIR choice. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @xoyenn they want to force sexuality on us w/o letting us express our own. they want to take+steal instead of receive what's freely given. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @xoyenn think abt the dif in reception for leaked nudes vs shared nudes. ppl love to look at leaks but shame those who share willingly. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @xoyenn and with people assuming my value is based on whether or not i fit in with their ideas of what the 'right' level of sexuality is. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @xoyenn i have a problem w/ others assuming that my sexuality is for them + they get to decide how, when, and why it is expressed. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @xoyenn that's the thing. it's CHOOSING to be sexual vs having it FORCED on you. i have no problem w/ being sexual. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @xoyenn yes, maybe i am. because i have the right to be sexual. i'm not giving it up just because other people are being gross. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @xoyenn @Alli_LameLace keeping clothes on treats the symptom, not the problem. problem isn't nudity. it's the REACTION to nudity. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @xoyenn @Alli_LameLace like... i don't care what they want. i care what i want. and sometimes, i want to take a pic of my titty. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @xoyenn @Alli_LameLace other people's moralizing isn't my problem. if they can't see my value just bc i took pics of my tits? lmao fuck'em. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @xoyenn @Alli_LameLace ok, but why should i have to be? who says not having clothes on is a bad thing? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Pure_Nonsense nudes are a part of that too. taking ownership of something that has historically been taken away from + used against us <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Pure_Nonsense +women are often judged for having sexuality outside of men's desire. women actually liking+having sex = 'slutty' and bad. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Pure_Nonsense it's being forced to be sexual for others vs. deciding you WANT to be sexual for yourself and those you choose to share with. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Pure_Nonsense nah. imposed from outside=do it the way WE want, bc u have to. Your choice? taking control of your sexuality for yourself. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Alli_LameLace media nudity implies u must be sexy bc others are entitled to enjoy ur body. Nudes? ME, being sexual w/ MY chosen partners. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Alli_LameLace it's abt being able to do it for YOU, because YOU want to express YOUR sexuality, instead of having it imposed on you. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Alli_LameLace culture loves to commodify + sexualize us without our consent. actually getting a chance to do it on your OWN? That's big. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> on some level we have to realize a more progressive future isn't inevitable. like, donald trump for prez is a real possibility. this is bad. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> the stories we latch onto mean something. why is so much popular fiction centered on the inevitability of our downfall? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Personally I think recent rise of dystopian fiction – hunger games, the 100, maze runner, walking dead, etc etc – is kinda telling <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> We assume that youth=radical and that we’re automatically better by virtue of our age. Not how it works <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Remember that study recently showing millennials are just as racist as the last gen and we just think we’re not? Yeah. That’s what I mean <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> That’s the thing abt people who say ‘it’ll happen eventually. It’s too soon. Someday.’ Why do u assume that? Why someday? Says who? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> But this isn’t true. There is no linear progress. We can backtrack, regress, reverse at any time; future is not inherently freer than past <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> That with every generation we get more liberated, more aware, more conscious than the one before; step by step, things will just improve <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> We assume that progress forward in time = progress forward in ‘social justice’. we think progress of society has been a linear process <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> While the sentiment is nice, to me it highlights a big flaw in reasoning: the assumption that the future is inherently progressive. <Text_End>
