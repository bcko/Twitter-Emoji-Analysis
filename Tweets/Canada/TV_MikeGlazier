<Text_Begin> @DrDrewHLN This girl obviously needs help and she will eventually end up dead. What is seriously wrong with this generation? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Sportsnet i like East vs West for the All-star game.Not a draft fan. Do a retro stanley cup team game 91 pens vs. chi. With the players <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Sportsnet instead of trying to find a reason to cheer for the Leafs maybe cast them aside and cheer on a different Canadian team <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @Sportsnet show us your expert opinion and cups? Oh wait STFU! Leafs have given up and are taking cheap shots <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @FriedgeHNIC love when pwople focus on the negative when they dont like the guy. If it was Gretzky writing it'd be figuratively speaking. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Sportsnet its funny and sad that if you add up the cost of the Jerseyon ice + fines at a Leafs game its still cheaper than the tickets. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @Sportsnet if the Leafs played as good as the announcers of the game said they did the game should have been 12-0 Toronto. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Sportsnet if your going to kick the players out of the crease then make the nets bigger. <Text_End>
