<Text_Begin> I must go now but I'm glad I was able to post that before busy family times started <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> also, despite the (very exciting) title there actually isn't a whole lot of dancing. sorry. anyway I hope people like it <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> anyway, back to work. I can probably get another three hours in before I crash <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> it's not a christmas fic that is a promise. it's super self-indulgent though <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm just rushing to get it done cuz I won't be able to work on it on those days cuz of Family Obligations and I will die if I can't finish <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> also I swear to god I didn't intend to possibly end up publishing it on christmas eve/christmas <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> it's charasriel fluff btw so sorry if you're not into that. maybe don't get your hopes up or anything <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It's not even good it's just SUPER FRUSTRATING not having it done when I know how close I am <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> this is, a very long fic for me, and I really want to be able to publish it either tonight or tomorrow, because it's killing me <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> still have two more scenes to do. I think this fic will end up being around 7-8k. my longest undertale fic yet whoaaaa <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @belowtale I wanna go BUT I'm writing so have fun!!! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @feralphoenix Ahh, thanks anyway, I'll figure out a way around it <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> does anyone happen to know where I can find fashion references? not pictures, but the vocabulary? descriptions? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> like I can either try to describe fashion I know nothing about or I can just say "they got dressed up and looked rad" <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> I wish I could do something nice for everyone for Christmas but the only thing I can think of is like writing everyone a drabble <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @belowtale LOUD GASP <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> so. I won't @ them, probably, but. jic. I like asriel and/or chara *crawls away* <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> um, I, kind of want to reply to nella, jic, but I don't want to presume anything? or put any pressure on them? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> in all seriousness "baby it's cold outside" played four times <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> the radio has played it like seven times at this point and the DJ says, "hey, before we okay another one, let's drop in one 'santa baby'" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> the 2nd time it plays, your first thought is not, "hey, someone's playing it again", it's "this song is a lot longer than I first thought" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> here's the thing about when "baby it's cold outside" plays over and over again: <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> my mom has the radio turned to a Christmas station and "baby it's cold outside" is playing for the third time in a row <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> domestic scenes are hard to write??? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ok I'm done with chores for today let's see how much writing I can get done <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @belowtale lmao now that I've said all that my tl has refreshed and is showing me that others have replied whoops <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> love live is problematic I know but the app is so good for stimming especially cuz I already tap my fingers and I'm obsessed with it <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @belowtale anyway the point is, you're not doing badly, it just takes a while to reach a point where you get high scores <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @belowtale like, a "pure" song (the green icon) should be done with a team made up of mostly "pure" cards cuz they offer a big bonus <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @belowtale when you start getting SRs and URs, they'll have skills that boost your score. also, you'll want a team that matches the song <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @belowtale since you're only just starting your team is composed of normals and rares that don't offer many bonuses <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @belowtale someone might have explained this already but your final score in love live is based on the quality of your team!! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> um. in the encouraging way, not the "you are always being watched" conspiracy kinda say <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> he's going to have to walk because he's a dumbass who got too used to me figuring everything out for him <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'M TIRED OF BEING THE ONE RESPONSIBLE FOR EVERYONE IN MY LIFE <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> whenever we travel together I'm the one who has to figure out the schedules and the transportation, OF COURSE he does this when he's alone <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I was excited about him coming home but now I'm just annoyed about how little responsibility he takes for his own life <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> we don't have a car to pick him up with and we don't have any cash wtf <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> my brother's bus arrived but he didn't get cab money for the ride home??? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm reading solstoria and these kids are really cute but something terrible is bound to happen <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I just get paranoid. like "oh god I'm the one who did that aren't I" when I've never said/done/thought anything even remotely close <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> sometimes I see ppl talking about stuff they've seen and I become convinced they're talking about me? even though they can't be? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> (odds of finishing tomorrow are unbelievably slim but I can Dream) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm hoping I can finish tomorrow?? but the odds of that are slim. if not I will have to finish over the weekend cuz Family Obligations <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @belowtale that sounds like a really good au honestly and I like it very much <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @belowtale what exactly is the shrine au. I thought it was something of yours but apparently it's official? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> thank god I returned from writing to find more shitposting baby frisk <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> 2800 words into this fic and chara and frisk have interacted more than chara and asriel whoops <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I am trying to be less exhausting for people <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> so like. I know that I can be hard. I know mental illness is hard. I know people don't want to deal with it <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I have been told a lot that I am exhausting and an abuser for lashing out sometimes haha <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I respect people who write that kinda thing though, even if it's hard for me <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I will probably continue to live in my fantasy world of denial and enabling <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> "what if...(character) realized caring for (troubled character) is exhausting?" well I mean that's realistic I guess but it makes me sad <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @neomettatons I dunno, that might not be the case for you. but it's ok to be upset about it <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @neomettatons It's scary to have people LIKE the idea of someone realizing that mental illness is tiring, cuz what does that mean for me? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @neomettatons you don't have to apologize. I get upset when people talk about stuff like that too <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> there's a woman who always wants to hug me when she sees me <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> my mom wants Dr Pepper and I haven't found any in three stores I'm gonna have to go to my old job sjjfkfksjajncn <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @neomettatons it doesn't have to mean asriel abandoning them, he just learns better ways to help care for them <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @neomettatons like, they want asriel to understand that being nice can't fix everything, so that he can help chara better <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @neomettatons I don't know if it helps but I think the ppl who talk about that happening only do so bc they want asriel to grow? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @neomettatons there are plenty of fictional AND real-world relationships where that never happens, people can stay okay <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @neomettatons I haven't seen any aus where that happens and there's no reason to think it necessarily would <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> like they'd stopped but they skidded on the ice for a bit and I still went to school that afternoon <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @belowtale I love it and I sort of want to write something someday maybe but I am so scared to write someone else's au <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> frisk: what do you call a fish with no legs 
chara: what
frisk: a fsh
chara: you were so close <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> anyway. anyway. I have shopping to do. nobody needs to know my random thoughts on anything <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I would absolutely love to be nothing. no gender, no orientation, no NOTHING, just pure distilled me <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I use she/her cuz I dunno if I can get used to other pronouns but, honestly???? just. throw out gender. let's all become blobs <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> it's so damn confining and I don't want to be like that at all <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> and that's, a big part of why I even started questioning, lol <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I would say "I don't want to dress like this" and I'd be told "girls just have to, no one will respect you otherwise" or whatever <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I know that gender isn't as simple as "girls wear makeup" but that's how it was taught to me <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I will, try to write something that isn't as projection-y or upsetting as soon as I can <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @neomettatons I think I get it?? I still wanna play the game to see it all, but if I have any questions I'll ask on skype maybe :o <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> why are people so mean to alphys. why is there so little alphys love in the fandom. jk I know why <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @simplycarryon the closest I have ever seen was a mash-up with professor frankly's theme which probably doesn't count <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> eh, whatever. I don't really need to figure this stuff out. I'm happy liking people and having people like each other with flowers involved <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> he seems nice but hE HELPED DECORATE THE CHRISTMAS TREE........boundaries are being crossed here <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> the point is how the fuck did my mom meet a guy and end up with him half-living in our house within like a week of meeting him in person <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> and I definitely love people! like my gf, I love her. but?? I wonder if it's the same for me as others seem to see it <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I feel weird about considering myself aro because I love the trappings of romance so much. kissing and dancing and flowers or whatever <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> like, he spent the entire weekend with us? he's been eating meals with us? who is this man. he is doing laundry in our basement <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> also how obligated am I to enact a wacky scheme to help my mother and her new friend who is a boy get together <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> anyway I'm working on my sad chara headcanon fic. it is not at all what I expected it to be but what else is new <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> my entire vocabulary will be replaced with the words "taxes" and "business" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> when I become an adult my skin will turn into a suit and I'll grow a briefcase. my glasses will become a permanent fixture <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> someday I'll figure it out and then I'll be an adult for real <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> and like. you can't have more than one Favourite. that's just silly (I know people DO but I'm still working on that part) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> my thought process for anything I ship is literally just "they are each other's Favourites so that must be...romance????" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> so in conclusion I'm a totally useless adult because my autistic mentally ill ass is still basically an infant <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> for whatever reason I need to have proper labels and compartments for everything and I can't just, ignore them <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> the answer is probably supposed to be "there ARE no boundaries" but listen. buddy. that doesn't work for me <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> and when people change things up like that it makes it harder to follow what the boundaries are supposed to be <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> that's probably why I'm not into multi/polyshipping? cuz it's already weird for me, and this is sort of how I'm practicing <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> it DOES matter, of course. I know that much. I just don't really get it <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I still have no idea what actually distinguishes certain kinds of relationships from one another, or why it matters so much <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> like my gf is cute and I love her but she doesn't know what the hell romance is either. we're basically Super Best Friends <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm Old now so I should probably have a better understanding of what relationships are than I actually do but well <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> for the record everything I ship ever is completely asexual. they hug and smooch cheeks and that's all. leave your sin at the door <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @neomettatons like even if I interpret it differently for different reasons there's no reason why you gotta deal with that, that's all <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @neomettatons it's ok I didn't even think you were being specific I just meant gross in general. but yeah, I'll try to be safer for you <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @neomettatons I just hope you don't think I'm trying to be gross about it, that's all. I'd be sad about that, but it's ok if you need space <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @neomettatons no, it's ok!! I don't feel bad, but even if I did, that's not what's important here <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @neomettatons so I'll try to be more careful about keeping it a safe space for you on my part, and feel free to tell me if I mess up <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @neomettatons it's kind of a dpd thing for me too, I think, even if I interpret it differently. but I don't want to ruin it for you <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @neomettatons I'll try to be careful so that you don't have to see uncomfy stuff from me, at least. your safety matters <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @neomettatons Yeah I saw you were talking about something else but I wanted to respond cuz it seemed.,.similar? and I got carried away <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @neomettatons it's more about me wanting characters to care about each other, than me trying to be creepy or gross <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @neomettatons it's kind of a coping thing for me...but I promise I don't see them as siblings, and I don't like sex stuff, so &gt;&gt;&gt; <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @neomettatons I can stop RTing stuff like that and I'll keep tagging it on tumblr so you can block it <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @neomettatons I don't know if this helps at all but I completely understand your feelings and think they're valid <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> the formatting on ao3 keeps messing up for me what the HECK <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @buccelIati in my defence I'm in a reasonable timezone (unlike you) so it's only 9pm here, also if I have to deal with them then so do you <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> how fucked up is it that he was literally trained to do that and it's just treated as a joke <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> he can't look at ppl directly and all his sprites have him looking off to the side unless he's glaring and like <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> edgeworth things that upset me: he literally does not know how to make positive eye contact <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I don't talk about ace attorney much on here but for the record edgeworth is my autistic son and I love him always <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KeltenaAsule I'm honestly heartbroken I wanted edgeworth to be the kind of kid who regularly bought $40 lunches <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KeltenaAsule I'm sorry edgeworth. That was a reasonable amount after all. We were wrong about you. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KeltenaAsule I just looked it up and apparently all the students brought in money at the beginning of the month to pay for the entire month <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KeltenaAsule I think it was like 3800 yen, which converts to about the same amount, doesn't it? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KeltenaAsule The anime had better address this <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KeltenaAsule https://t.co/G7BRd7J7EY <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> what the fuck kind of fourth grader brings $40 for lunch. don't answer that, I already know that edgeworth would <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ok so phoenix wright was accused of stealing edgeworth's lunch money. wasn't it, like, almost $40? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> "undertale theories: chara is gaster" ?????????????????????????????????????????????? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @vacantVisionary thank you, that's really kind of you...I'm feeling a little better now, but?? it's still really nice to hear <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> the feeling: guilt, bc if people like it so much you are probably bad for not caring <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> tfw you don't ship something and it's fine but you see it so much that you start to downright hate it <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> the point is, be kind to robots <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> like if I'd been a prisoner of this guy my entire life I absolutely would've seized the chance to kill him and escape, ANYONE would <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> in the discussion afterwards everyone talked about how scary she was but honestly I'd have done the exact same thing lmao <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> he literally created a sentient being and refused to give her freedom of ANYTHINg, so like, no duh she turned on you???? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> only it wasn't the Turing test it was some made up bs. anyway the point is he wanted her to be as human as possible, but he never let her go <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I watched a movie for my sci fi class before, I can't remember the name, but a guy built an android and wanted to perform the Turing test <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I love robots. I know nothing about the building of them but robots themselves are so cute. all robots are my children <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> so the fact that humans are actually teaching robots to say no and protect themselves is nice and that's my two cents <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> if you want to give something agency and the ability to think, then respect that agency??? let them think??????? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> they create life, but they never treat the robots like they're sentient. they want them to think like humans but treat them like objects <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> the problem all scientists make in  those movies where robots rise up against humanity is, they don't take responsibility <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> I'm just talking it out cuz I started a thing that has flashbacks to chara's past and I wanted to try and settle it, I guess <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @RINMAKlS I'm glad you think so bc I'm trying to convince myself that the way I'm writing chara isn't necessarily super ooc <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> thus I will continue to depict chara as a highly-strung radical memer <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> thus the fact that my chara is a foul-mouthed brat is actually extremely Positive <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> but when they're feeling safe + relaxed they get a lot more wild and crude <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> so when they're feeling upset or are starting to dissociate they default to that behaviour, hence the way they speak in NM <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> cuz if they were Good and Well-Behaved then people would be appeased and they might not get in trouble <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> anyway it was probably super strict and they developed a habit of smiling and talking/behaving formally as a defensive thing <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> not to say that people CAN't be affectionate with anyone they want it's just not something I personally want for myself or my stories <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> "they're kissing?? what the fuck???? I thought they were platonic friends. this is too much. everything's getting fucked up" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> that's probably why I get weird about physical intimacy actually, in my head it blurs the lines of what kinda relationship it is <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I Will Not Talk About Polyshipping Anymore <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @buccelIati ugh, thanks...it's probably a dumb thing to worry about, I just feel like I'm not being fair or something <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I definitely do have SOME polyships (fucking toradora) it's just not really a go-to thing for me <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> real life absolutely definitely does not work like that I KNOW just let me have my fantasy of everything being tidy and simple <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> like, one person with one person in a very specific kind of way, keep it easy, keep everything compartmentalized <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @buccelIati I get WHY people polyship and I totally respect that I just feel guilty a lot cuz my own brain can't really deal with it <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm not good with relationships in general I think so in fiction I tend to idealize them by keeping them as simple as I can <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> and going "make all the people involved kiss!" just makes things more complicated for me because then the relationship makes even less sense <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> if I ship two characters, then I tend to stop right there. getting other people involved makes things messy and weird <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I just, don't like that. I don't know. I'm probably close-minded. but I want relationships to be super clear-cut and defined <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @smtp3p god, that's a relief?? sometimes I get really self-conscious over not wanting to ship everyone together <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> that was my deep dark secret btw. that I'm not an ot3/multishipper kinda person even though everyone I know IS <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I get that monogamy is boring and non-inclusive or whatever. but. it's, my preference <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ and sometimes ppl don't want to be in a relationship that involves more than one person, haha......... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ it's totally ok for people to do that!! but I see a lot of ppl acting like it's the natural/best solution? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> like I don't want to feel like I or my characters should be open to polyamorous relationships just to minimize drama. so. yeah. I'll stop <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I feel self-conscious even saying that lol. it's just, some people, aren't into that? and shouldn't feel pressured? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> but also. some people, don't, want to write that as a resolution. so. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> like polyamory is absolutely ok and a great solution for a lot of them <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> "why write love triangles when you can do polyamory" cool but....some people..........don't want that <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> *under my breath* nobody must ever know my deepest darkest secret of all <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @RINMAKlS yeah I skimmed the article and saw and like...that makes sense, I guess?? but how did I never hear of this before <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> I have no idea where this came from but from now on asriel is canonically REALLY INTO BREAKFAST <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> "is that really all your having?" he asks when he sees frisk with their good ol' cheerios. meanwhile asriel is cooking like an entire store <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> asriel never eats cereal for breakfast he's one of those people who needs a whole fucking meal. like. eggs and bacon and pancakes and toast <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> frisk is a wholesome cheerios kinda kid <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> chara would probably like to punish themselves with froot loops and other cereals that chew up your mouth <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> what kind of cereal would the undertale characters like <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> imagine _____ getting up in the morning. imagine what kind of pajamas they like to wear. what kind of breakfast cereal would they prefer? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> the older I get, the more mundane my fandom interests get <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> "WHY WON'T THEY STAY CLEAN I'VE BEEN WIPING THEM FOR FIVE HOURS MOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMM" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ok no I feel bad. cancel this. go back to imagining cute older asriel with cute glasses <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> just kidding this isn't a fun thing to imagine at all because glasses suck. asriel gets glasses and cries for three days <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> this is, absolutely my own problem and one I shouldn't trouble other people over, probably <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> like, unless someone is in a committed devoted romantic relationship, even just two people holding hands seems too personal and too much <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> I headcanon frisk as being 8-10 and chara as being around 11 or 12 <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> flowey: BOOGITY BOOGITY BOO *waving leaves like arms*
chara: what a pretty flower! I bet it would look nice in my hair =)
flowey: (Íí™»èÍí™;) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> only it still doesn't work chara is just =) so he has to slink away in embarrassment <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm thinking of flowey trying to scare chara only chara is totally =) about everything so he resorts to jumping out and going BOO <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ the curse is sort of broken but it's like shrek where chara turns into a monster too instead of asriel changing back <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> the curse is never broken chara is totally happy to live with a TV-faced plant monstrosity for the rest of their life <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> only chara would probably be like "whoa you look rad like that" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> only there'd have to be some dramatic moment where he becomes Photoshop flowey for some reason and suddenly he IS really scary <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I want to do it now. I totally do. I love the idea of teeny tiny cute flower beast and chara is just like "what the fuck" <Text_End>

chara: it's a spider <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> chara: so you just named it after the first thing you saw??
asriel: well I mean. what else was I supposed to do <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> idea for a fic: asriel and chara get a pet tarantula <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> why you gotta be like that azzy. why you gotta be weird <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @meyecy look I hate to say it but asriel would absolutely be into the whole guro aesthetic <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> like, not ALL the time. but I mean. he looks so cute and innocent and he would probably want a pet tarantula. that kind of thing <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> why does my brain keep associating random anime songs with undertale? jk I know why it's because I'm a nerd <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> things I need to work on: having my own opinions, not feeling guilty about my own opinions, not changing my own opinions to match others <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> like it's obviously a joke!! BUT replace the statues with any generic anime boy and you'd get a totally standard music show <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Getting dangerously close to wank territory so I'm stopping now <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> and it's not like I ship it in that "who deserves her most" way I ship it in the "toriel canonically prefers sans' company so whatever" way <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> torgore is definitely bad so I will talk about that but it's not like i yell at people over soriel <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> like I enjoy soriel I don't enjoy torgore or w/e you wanna call it that doesn't mean I'm gonna yell at people who disagree <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> but you mostly leave people alone about it, yet people still insist that by shipping it you are taking part in the wankfest <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ship wars are dumb as hell but the thing that's most frustrating is when you DO ship something and adamantly don't ship something else <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ @RINMAKlS lol yeah there are <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> she has zero fucking patience for asgore though so just leave her alone I don't care how cute they were pre-canon <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> them being bffs is just as good as anything else imo <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> the reason I'm ok with soriel whether romantic or platonic is bc toriel pretty clearly, y'know, actually enjoys sans' company <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @feralphoenix I feel like a FOOL but I guess that explains a lot <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> this isn't a joke I legitimately thought sinning was just a general term for being. I dunno. excessive? in fandom? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> wait apparently when people talk about sinning in fandom they mean sex stuff. oh my god <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> friends? cool! more than friends? whoa there <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> like I don't want to rush stuff just cuz I'm insecure about it, I want to actually work hard at something <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> but, different isn't necessarily, bad? anyway when I say I want to write proper fanfic I just mean that I want to put thought into it <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> especially if I really like what they've done, lol. I feel like "oops I fucked up with my version cuz it doesn't match theirs" <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> "CHARA'S GOOD DON'T LISTEN TO ANYBODY WHO TELLS YOU OTHERWISE" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> he finally beat the game and I infodumped so fucking hard on him <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> that's why my favourite pre-canon interpretation of asriel is him being kind of whiny and selfish instead of just a pushover <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I dunno! I just feel like it's important to recognize that asriel felt like he was getting something from it too <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> which, I mean, they probably did. but asriel depended on them too, obviously <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I feel like it's easy to assume that...chara leaned on asriel? like, they depended on him a lot, or took advantage of his good nature? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I feel like it's important that asriel says chara was the only one who understood him and I can't fully articulate why? <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> I read. a lot of porn because of that. but I mean at least I figured out what it meant <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> yu GI oh, even. anyway they kept making thiefshipping jokes and I didn't know what the fuck that meant so I looked it up <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> unrelated to anything but my first encounter with shipping as a concept was the result of my friends making me watch yu go oh abridged <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ I want to emphasize that the things I saw should not be seen by anyone <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @RINMAKlS @chemiosmotic_ you should probably be concerned about the things I am willing to subject myself to in the name of curiosity <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ yes and that's all I'm saying about it <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I can't be bothered to take anything off cuz being all bundled up feels nice. good pressure <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I went to the store and ever since I got back I've just been sitting here in my jacket and boots and scarf and hat <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ myself, no more complimenting other people I'm getting self-conscious <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> everything she writes is, good, even when it hurts me, and I am excited for a longfic <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> someone else's fire was the first undertale fic I ever read and the one that made me start feeling better about associating with chara SO <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @belowtale @okikazutoshi WHAT THE FUCK!!! WHAT THE FUCK!!!!!! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> *picks up asriel* never talk to me or my son ever again <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> 4 minutes into part 3 of the dog island and they have died twice, incredible <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> aus where chara absolutely thrives when they grow up is the reason why I still get up in the morning <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @buccelIati EVERYONE WOULD BE SO IN LOVE WITH THEM AND ASRIEL WOULD JUST BE LIKE üòè <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @lumalees I hc chara as not really wanting that?? but at the same time if they DID, If they changed their MIND <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> CHARA WOULD BE SO BEAUTIFUL AND AWE-INSPIRING AS A RULER THOUGH LIKE WOW <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @feralphoenix STOP I'M TOO WEAK FOR THIS <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @feralphoenix Are You Trying To Kill Me <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> my weaknesses:

-throw in masks or capes and I'm dead <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I have been waiting for the return of the dog island my entire life <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @RINMAKlS Holy f uck <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @buccelIati GET TO IT!!! CHOP CHOP!!!!!! (no pressure though) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> they're a prince and princex they deserve to wear crowns <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> listen....listen........more people should draw asriel and chara in royal garb. with crowns <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> *historian voice* and elesa's gym theme from bw2 remains the absolute shit to this very day <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> second thing they see is chara sitting in the corner sharpening a katana and staring at them with their huge, unsettling eyes <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> they go over to his house and the first thing they see is a cabinet full of knives and swords <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> someone meets asriel for the first time and they think he seems really nice and sweet and hope they can become good friends with him <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @buccelIati asriel cries when he sees it, it's the most beautiful knife he's ever seen, the others are so Concerned <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @RINMAKlS ABSOLUTELY (that or, like, a display case of them) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> asriel winds up with a collection of literally hundreds of knives and he loves each and every one of them <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> it's not laziness though they just genuinely think a knife is the best thing they can give him. it's the ultimate expression of affection <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> and now I'm thinking about chara giving asriel a knife like every fucking time they need to get a present for him <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I saw a tweet about the presents in new home having been a gift exchange between chara and asriel <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I need somebody to bring me tea and brush my hair very gently and then be a cat who sits on my lap <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> *wakes up* *feels sick* this is fine <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> it might, have something to do with it being 2:30 am <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> just saw an undertale character poll that called asriel the "secret third goat" i'mcryinf laughing <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @buccelIati he's my brother's favourite and I'm so upset about it <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> actually of all people nella would probably know how much a ryojibot can be appreciated best <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @belowtale I would appreciate a ryojibot so much you don't even kNOW <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'll settle for other people wearing/drawing skirts and letting me admire them <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @rubynymphy I wish I had more skirts!! I mean I wouldn't wear them because I'm shy but they're so pretty <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ This is slander <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> if you are having a hard and tiring day, you should consider taking a break and relaxing with a nice fic, mayhaps <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> for some reason it didn't occur to me that it was a gay thing to write a game about a bunch of lesbians in love with each other <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> probably the gayest thing I ever did without realizing I was gay was plan a yuri dating sim <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ @RINMAKlS Roisin as a neutral third party you gotta judge the winner <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> I'm so tired you guys <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @RINMAKlS I CHANGED MY MIND LET'S HAVE A YELLING CONTEST <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @RINMAKlS I was joking pls don't yell at me <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> (I'm, kidding, and that little fic was cute) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @RINMAKlS "this is Cute" um :) sweaty :) why aren't you recommending one of MY fics :) :) :) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I guess they ran out of animals that could be described as crying <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> what the frick there's going to be a new 07th expansion manga. "When the fireflies burn" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I keep misreading bergentruckung as Burger King <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> =) always seems to have an underlying sense of "I just killed a man and I feel great about it!!!!" to me <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ yeah, :) is just toxic at this point but =) can still be pure <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ =) feels extremely energetic to me but I mean it could also be the kind of energy where you wanna stab people <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ I feel like =) is more intense than :) but not necessarily hateful? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ I will, just gotta sit for a bit. I'll probably have an early dinner today to make up for it <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> honestly if I'm alive something's bound to be killing me whether it's my breathing or my anemia or my stomach or my food issues <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ nah, it's not that today, I just haven't been eating enough and it suddenly caught up with me <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> oh fuck suddenly feel like I might pass out, whoops <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> so I mean, what's not to love <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> -cute + happy song 
-the dancing cat girl is a gigantic, inexplicably strong canadian who's in love with meat <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> like there's no reason why you can't just have a fun time coming up with gems for all the characters...you don't have to connect it all <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Steven universe au is cute but maybe don't try to fit ut characters into the roles of su characters when it fucks up the dynamics like that <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ Ew ew ew ew ew ew ew ew <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ ruby and sapphire are Gay...it's not......the same thing.............. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @feralphoenix do you think you'll ever write/draw anything else for that au? I really like your take on it <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @feralphoenix that makes sense honestly even if it makes me kinda sad <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> only it was paralleling ruby and sapphire fusing back into garnet???? and, they're brothers???????? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> another su/ut thing that pisses me off is, I saw fanart of sans and papyrus fusing into that comic papyrus thing <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ I wanna say yes but I'm supposed to be doing hw so I won't tempt myself until I'm free I think <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> so, like, using it in the context of sans beating up a child pisses me off <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> specifically, romantic queer love, and how societal prejudices can't hold them back forever <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> stronger than you isn't about literally being a better fighter it's about how empowering love can be <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ I haven't watched it but I hate the very idea of it <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ NICE!!! I can't wait to read it!!!! (If that's okay I mean) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @meyecy You are .......dangerous <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> they sing it while kicking the player's ass <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @meyecy I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU MADE ME READ THAT WITH MY OWN TWO EYES <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> *thinks about su au chara and asriel fusion singing stronger than you" holy fuck <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @meyecy NOOOOOOOOO <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> all you kids out there should play hit new indie jame "undefratbale" by tony wolf <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> "undefratbale" sounds like something senor cardgage would say <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> thanks autocorrect https://t.co/Ap0vUOwSCx <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> that is my sacred wish *ascii art of a praying anime girl* <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> chara fell as a damaged little kid but gets back up again as Undefeatable War God Monster Royalty <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ the world thought they could bring them down but then they emerge STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> asriel as a king + chara as captain of the royal guard + frisk as their weird (but adorable) baby = my aesthetic <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> everyone who'd ever hurt them would just be like. "oh, shit" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> and they're big and buff and have a giant sword and have a family of enormous magical monster royals <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> imagine them returning to the surface along with the other monsters when the barrier's broken someday (somehow) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I should be focusing on work but instead I'm thinking about royal guard chara <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @aryllins: (UNDERTALE SPOILERS!)
I uh. I might be working on an AU...
(undermonogatari...???) https://t.co/WH74yiMTUD <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ agender nageki...is good <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> -channel their aggressive impulses into something healthy
-learn to defend themselves + feel safe
-they can protect their family!! whoa!!!! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> chara learning how to use a sword and properly fight would be so good honestly <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> they're used to putting on this polite, dignified front to appease others but secretly they're a little punk <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ I feel like chara would be a lot like undyne honestly <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm still convinced they wouldn't really wanna be a royal BUT a member of the guard is something else entirely <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I have nothing to follow that up with, really? but imagine them learning how to swing a really big sword <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> things I like to think about in the "asriel and chara survive and grow up" au: chara joining the royal guard <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I swear I'm not trying to be mean like it wasn't BAD or anything it just reminded me of that <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I just saw a wip asriel cosplay and they looked like david bowie in labyrinth and I choked on my pie <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> speaking of pie I just now got pie from the cafeteria. it's apple and I'm eating it COLD <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ That's definitely the Ideal but I mean...it's not BAD if it's cold...sometimes it's even better <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ I've only ever eaten sweet pies, yeah. I guess savoury ones would probably be kinda gross cold lol <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> hot pie is like if you've baked the pie yourself, most people just get pre-made I think and don't bother to warm them <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ hot pie is the ideal but I mean if you're lazy cool pie is just as good <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ I don't think it's actually a super common recipe but people have been making some based on undertale https://t.co/7LDFtQCwAp <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @belowtale THANK YOU I'M SO GLAD PPL LIKE IT <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @RINMAKlS THANK YOU I'M GLAD YOU THINK SO (I actually thought so myself but didn't wanna get all full of myself) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> what is this world coming to <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I can't fucking believe I wrote a fic from a perspective other than chara and asriel's and actually involved other characters <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ (it wasn't everyone was just being nice and frisk was too proud of themselves to realize) (also thank you!!) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> frisk has exactly as much baking talent as I do <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @feralphoenix I should add the tag "based on a true story" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> things that will always be funny = the big time fucko amalgamate <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> why haven't I eaten yet today (I'm lazy) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I found the notes for it the other day and decided to actually write it. something cute (hopefully???) about some kiddos trying to do a Good <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ah! wow! whoa! it's a 'fic' https://t.co/7MxFlUVReQ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> and I went to sign them out and woke up and realized none of them fucking exist so now I'm mad <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ aw you're so nice!! also GET A BETTER TIME ZONE WHAT THE HELL <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> it's nothing special. it's very silly. I wrote it to try and cleanse myself of sad ut thoughts <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> thank you ppl for answering but I'm just gonna wait until morning cuz I always hate publishing stuff at night and this way I'll feel better <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> what time is it for everyone. I wrote something and am considering publishing it but I don't want to if it's like 3 am for most of you. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> I was tempted to write something unnecessarily angsty...not today, satan <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @charratorbot thank you! so do you! you always look nice <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ you have been Chosen <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @charratorbot you are good!! you are good and you deserve to know *pats your head* <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> there's also, like, mystery and political intrigue, but it's been a while since I've read it so I don't remember all the details, whoops <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> reasons why
1. dragons
2. dragons who are heavily coded as autistic
3. main character is a court musician and there's tons of music stuff <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> this is random but if you haven't read the book seraphina you totally should <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @charratorbot you ok, sweetie? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KeltenaAsule seriously? I guess I just don't talk to other people with ocs enough <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @rubynymphy good I love the void too we're getting married even <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> has anyone else ever done that weeb thing where they figure out who would voice their ocs in an anime. no? just me? okay <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @charratorbot You do!! You do and I love you and you can't stop me <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> anyway!!!!! time to try and get some writing done <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> *screaming into a pillow* Skype is terrifying why is it more scary than tweeting into the void <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @charratorbot I love you <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @RINMAKlS That sounds perfectly honestly <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> anyway my favourite ut comic is the one where asriel tells chara "if you don't stop meme-ing on us I'm going to burn ALL of your pepes" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @RINMAKlS okay! uh sorry if I suck at Skype I'm kind of bad at conversations uh uh um <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> so yeah that's if anyone wants it but don't feel obligated everything is cool <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> if I'm already following you on Twitter I'll accept, but I'm shy and might not initiate convos at first, I dunno <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> so, my skype is allegoricalabsurdity (that was my pesterchum handle from my homestuck days lol) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Um!! I'm gonna do it anyway I think just let me build up the nerve <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I wanna give out my skype but also I get kind of overwhelmed when I have lots of people I can talk to at once haha uh <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> now everything is in balance <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> my twitter name now matches my skype name <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ i'M SORRY I JUST DON'T LIKE CHANGE <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I have, betrayed the amalgamate <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ @RINMAKlS "greetings. they are big time fucko. the amalgamate that comes when you call my name" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I CAN' T DO THIS I NEED TO CHANGE BACK I'm SORRT <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I DUNNO IF I CAN LEAVE IT LIKE THIS...... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> this feels so wrong <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ @RINMAKlS .............. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> MY TL IS NOTHING BUT BIG TIME FUCKOS FAVINg SHIT AND MENTIONING ME WHY <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ it's gotta be, yeah, which is probably why it hasn't really taken off as a fandom trend (even though they're so good) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ there was but it used almost entirely stolen fanart. I dunno what's going on with it anymore (this one used screenshots tho) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> "you were my everything, which, upon reflection, was probably the problem" ouch <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> also I just saw an undertale/softer world edit with chara and asriel <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ I didn't expect to love hatoful so much?? but I DO and I can't wait <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> nella makes me feel very excited about holiday star <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ I published so much and I sincerely hope that nobody I now know ever ever ever finds any of them ever <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ lmao I used to churn out like one 5k fic a day for fucking mlp <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ Thank you, that's sweet!!! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ I measure special interests by how much fanfic I write about it, I was into homestuck but never wrote a dang thing <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ It's such a relief to have a special interest again especially something so positive <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ SAME about the special interest thing!!! my last big Thing was fucking MLP in like, 2011, 2012 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> anyway look at these socks https://t.co/J7DfQoBUCU <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> but undertale makes me happy for real!! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> cuz when I was little I was really cheerful and everyone wanted smiley silly shaylyn back <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> for the longest time my life felt like it was out of tune and everything was wrong and dull and numb but I tried SO HARD to act happy <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Really enjoying a game makes me feel kind of human again and it's a good feeling <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I dunno how to phrase it better than that haha. but I mean in addition to having comforting themes, it just, made me feel about things again <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I know it's just a game but honestly it's been ages since I've felt passionate about anything <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> undertale means a lot to me!! it's very sweet and funny and it gave me something to really care about again <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> anyway I'm fucking exhausted so I'm gonna eat something and take the rest of the day off to try and write I think <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> my chara is, a lot of projection. but it's nice to have someone to project onto that people love. that's what I'm saying <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> but I know I've scared my mom and brother, and I know there's a history of Loud Scary Mental Illness in my family, so I mean <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I think I probably have a totally different persona online than I do in real life so I dunno how seriously anyone takes me haha <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> so yeah!!!! soft chara stuff means a lot to me. the end <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> soft chara stuff is like "no shh it's ok you can be ok and ppl can still love and forgive you" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> and I can totally see myself wanting revenge and turning genuinely scary if the opportunity arose and I hate that <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm kind of fucked up? and prone to violent impulses and those loud angry Mentally Ill moments that people find so scary <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> like, "you can be this fucked up and ppl will still love you", and it just made me feel so much better about how gross I am <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> but soft chara squad was so dedicated to sympathizing with them that it was, comforting? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> but I associated with them instantly and I specifically didn't love them cuz I saw myself in them <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> some soft chara appreciation appears to be going on right now so for the record I didn't immediately love chara <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> oh my fucking god I'm finally back in my room and I am so tired and out of breath hate hate haaaate <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @fleshbows: If you need to give a skeleton a ghost dick to make it sexy I don't think you get to call yourself a skeletonfucker. Just my‚Ä¶ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> my chest hurts now because of this stupid walk and i hate everything I'm ending the world <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ok maybe not I don't even own a locket but I'll probably do something like that <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> If I ever get my hands on a soulless pacifist postcard I will carefully cut chara out of the picture and put it in a locket <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I actually forgot there were already shirts tho I was thinking of striped cosplay shirts or like the Cool Dude shirt <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @RINMAKlS please do, I wanna see!! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> *wheezing in the cold air, trudging through the waist-deep snow* I'm FINE....,., <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I walked all the way to the fricken bus depot only to find out they'd changed the hours of operation so they're closed until 4:30 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @RINMAKlS yeah, same <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> speaking of merch WHERE ARE THE OFFICIAL SHIRTS <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I wish there was official chara merch that wasn't based on nm but I'm desperate and also getting it DOES involve "selling the your soul" so <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @feralphoenix I know...I know...but I'm weak and will settle for any chara <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @feralphoenix frisk is from Toby's twitter, chara is from Courtney's/RINMAKIS https://t.co/TinQCfeQKX <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> "shaylyn" you say, "you HOPE your brother sold his soul? shame on you!" look none of us are going to heaven anyway <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ANYWAY I HOPE IF HE GOT IT HE SOLD HIS SOUL FOR THE CHARA POSTCARD <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> what's it like growing up in a house where it's normal to directly ask for things you want, I wonder. must be nice <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @rubynymphy lol thanks, I just don't want my family to feel pressured or anything I guess <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I feel, bad, for even saying that omg. I shouldn't expect anything for Christmas I'm sure whatever anyone could get me will be nice <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I really hope he got it for me for Christmas sob <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I wasn't able to order any undertale merch cuz of money issues but my brother knows how much I love it <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> winter has officially stopped being magical and is now just kind of gross and muddy <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> ok no more complaining. only breakfast <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @feralphoenix it was, the stupidest garbage I had ever heard, I wanted to punch someone when he told me that <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> and I still don't even have a diagnosis like they won't call it asthma they just give me inhalers and tell me to be careful on stairs <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> anyway how fucking dumb is that. what kind of doctor doesn't take something like that into account <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> and it's not enough for you so yeah there is definitely a problem" and I was like yeah no shit <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> then finally one doctor said "you're taking in enough for a normal person but you're so tall that you're lungs are bigger <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> and they were all like "well you seem to be taking in a normal about of oxygen, it all seems fine, we dunno what's wrong with you" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> anyway the dumbest thing that's ever happened to me is when I started going to see doctors for my breathing issues <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Medical// maybe? If no one wants to know? but I'm in a complaining mood <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> dear everyone who gets to enjoy unlaboured breathing: fuck yuo <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> just not important in the way everyone wants him to be lmao <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> and it's sad!! it's really sad. I love him bc I can relate to this, I want him to be ok, and he's definitely IMPORTANT <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> he's not secretly pulling the strings, he's not masterminding anything, he's not the true hero. he's depressed and he's given up <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> he's a good character and has a fantastic boss fight but the whole point of his character is that he's given up, guys <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ what the hell?? that's, weird. tell him not to do that anymore <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> see this is what I mean. this is what happen when the gays try to discuss food <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ no that's nasty as hell. when they're firm like that they're still bitter and gross <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I lied actually? the best thing on this awful planet is the caramel apple cinnamon pudding cake from safeway <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ you can't just let them ROT you have to time it just right. they need to be like golden with just a teeny tiny hint of brown <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> I'm very passionate about bananas because my mom has this weird thing about them. she's not allergic exactly but she fucking hates them <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ it's a cake only with banana in it and that makes it excellent in fact?? clearly you've never had good banana bread <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> it's really squishy and soft and sweet and I could eat an entire loaf of it <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> the best kind of bread is natural bakery rye, but you have to, like, remove the crust and mash it into a ball <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ sorry I couldn't hear you over how BLOCKED you are (you're right about plain brown being good though) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> banana bread is delicious if you don't agree I'm blocking you right now <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ THIS IS THE BEST THING ANYONE HAS EVER TOLD ME THANK YOU <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> my favourite lesbian thing is how passionate we get about food on tumblr. "what kind of bread do you like" "I like banana read" "fuck you" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ omf g that's a good one too. actually you're right all gay memes are good <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I wonder if I'm the handmaiden or the feudal lord in my relationship <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ it's my favourite I'm so happy <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> handmaiden: I shall bring you your scrolls milord
feudal lord: haha and then what ;) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I got handmaiden/feudal lord <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I should do homework but I'm taking the gay meme quiz instead <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I literally have a sandwich right here I should probably be, like, eating it <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @feralphoenix *frantic waving* <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> disordered eating// it is 1 pm and I still haven't eaten yet today, whoops. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @feralphoenix I'm in pain <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ @belowtale WE ARE <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> *soft sweet lullabies* I WANNA BEEEE THE VERY BEST <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> what the fuck I'm listening to this relaxing sleepy music box playlist while I work and the pokemon theme just came on <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I get paid this friday?? I might preorder holistar, because I'm very looking forward to it <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> my heart is warmed through imagining a safe and happy alive children au but now I need to finish this Thing <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> winning everyone's hearts over and over again through how easily they return it <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I like to picture them just basking in the constant affection <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> frisk is such a lucky kid honestly they end up with like fifty surrogate parents <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> "It's cold outside take a sweater" "I have six" "take another just in case" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm picturing chara being like that parent who always wants to know if you're properly bundled up now <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> gifts are an easy and comfortable way of showing affection. frisk eventually has five hundred sweaters <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> they don't know how to do this so they settle for constantly knitting them things <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> chara is super freaked out by other people for the longest time (if not always) but frisk is good and safe and they need to repay them <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @meyecy YES!!!! frisk literally always wants to be carried no matter how old they get <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ thank u I think so too <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @meyecy yes!!! exactly. frisk humours them bc that way they get lots of cuddles <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ frisk is definitely the Mature one of the group and basically takes care of everybody but chara and asriel like to pretend <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> frisk is infinitely more grown-up than either of them they don't know what they're doing but they want to be Cool Big Siblings <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> like the age difference isn't even that big but frisk is tiny so they're like "we must protect this baby" and frisk is like "yeah all right" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> my favourite chara+asriel+frisk dynamic is, chara and asriel treating frisk like their child <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> it's warmer than usual so the flakes are so huge and soft and it makes me want hot chocolate and a big scarf <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> IT'S SNOWING IN THE MOST PERFECT WAY TODAY!!! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @NintendoAmerica: Let us help make your holidays feel a little more warm and cozy.
https://t.co/5YVljp2eP0 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ok I finally actually got dressed and did stuff to my hair so now I feel a little less messy and can go to the library to work <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ we can be radical bald buddies. that can be the name of our gang even <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> God today is a gross day so far. Nothing in particular has happened I just feel messy and unpleasant <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> the goop thing is so bad that I can't even handle messy food lmao like if a piece of fruit is too juicy I just can't eat it <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ YES exactly. for me the worst is lipstick/lipgloss, I just can't handle that goopy feeling on my mouth <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm honestly just going to shave my head someday who needs hair <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ I wish I could do makeup and hair stuff bc it looks nice but it just never feels comfortable ugh <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> she said I'd get used to it but lol no <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> my mom used to try and show me how to do makeup but it always felt so heavy like mud smeared on my face <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> how the hell do people do their hair and makeup every day. how is that a thing people can do without it feeling gross and heavy and wrong <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I don't actually care anymore I went with rustic <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> the answer is, I wound up spending actual real money on this game because I have no self-control (only like four dollars though) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> alternative option, "how the fuck did you save up that many gold fish" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> how should I remodel my yard in neko atsume <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @feralphoenix Whoops, you're right actually, sorry. Got curious and didn't think about that <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @feralphoenix Ooh ok. Can I ask what fic it was? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'll need to spend tomorrow studying and the weekend working on other take home exams but today at least I'm gonna take it easy (hopefully) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> goals for today 
-finish and submit this stupid take-home exam 
-RELAX FOR ONCE!!!!!!!!!! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @feralphoenix what au is this I'm intrigued <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> my brother is so mad at me about this bc he mastered literally everything and wants me to do the same <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I was perfectly satisfied stopping once I got my cute hunter outfit and my cute butterfly wife <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @buccelIati What the fuck???People like this exist?????? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I just remembered that fantasy life exists and the only job I ever mastered was hunter. whoops <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ YES but HOW tall,..too often have I seen characters depicted as tall only to find out their canon heights are like 5"8 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I really wanna be carried someday because I love the idea of being Held like that but sadly I am too big <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @meyecy @feralphoenix Undertall, the au where everyone is actually a fucking giant, hundreds of feet tall <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @feralphoenix yes!!! I hope so. I want to be picked up by the strong goat parents <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I need to know the canon heights of the undertales. who am I shorter than <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> *pops my head out of the dirt* asriel with DID <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ they were just playing around with their imaginations and then everything got all intense <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> in other news this is absolutely canon (blood tw??) https://t.co/FNNJQcVyoY <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ aw thank you ;_; it's, not, but thank you <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @feralphoenix THANK you, I am perfectly satisfied to remain in my rut <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> "you should try writing about something other than chara and asriel" *hisses and curls around my children protectively* <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @mintliquid: undertale is still good

i love chara and frisk https://t.co/g5pVLLwznq <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> hogwarts houses are a fun + cute silly thing but it's not actually that big a deal if ravenclaw merch is hard to find <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I just saw a really angry post about hufflepuffs not getting enough respect and like?? it's not real???? relax <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> why do people get so upset over hogwarts houses <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I feel like I need to lie down now because of hatoful boyfriend <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I AM SO READY FOR HOLIDAY STAR <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> FUCK!!!! DON'T CRY OVER BIRDS!!!!!!!!! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm finally finishing bbl and it's fucking me up so bad <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @belowtale NO YOU'RE RIGHT IT'S JUST REALLY FUNNY BC I NEVER THOUGHT OF IT BEFORE AND IT'S SO ACCURATE <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm super hungry now and am having trouble concentrating and also the library's gonna close in an hour so I guess I'll stop <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> when did I stop trying to correct my typos online. when did I start thinking of them as giving my typing 'personality' <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @belowtale I'M LAUGHING REALLY HARD ABUOT SHUU BEING A SAPIOSEXUAL NOW <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I know it's meant to be positive but I always hear it as "you can't change and you're still awful even if you try to be good" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> the "despite everything, it's still you" line still fucks me up though <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> the moral of the story is, follow your dreams, kids <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> "and not just in a self-hatredy kind of way" so now I'm super protective of them and it's much better <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> but then I saw more and more people sympathizing with them and I was like "oh! it's ok to like them in a normal way" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> like I was convinced they were a demon and had to be Bad and yet I immediately related to them, probably because I think I'm Bad a lot <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I used to be afraid of chara bc I thought they were evil but I still liked them and projected myself onto them which was probably weird <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> this one specific thing isn't due until tomorrow at 5 pm, so maybe I can, stop, and finish it tomorrow <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm gradually losing the will to do homework <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> I'm very fond of the king and am completely convinced that I will love him <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> what a good line?? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> my brother just sent me a text about korra saying "so far the alphabet has more plot twists than this show" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ myself, stop biting your fuckening nails <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @belowtale ok that makes me feel better nm I was suddenly so concerned <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> because nella made me realize that shuu fucking comes at hiyoko with a cleaver and if he was actually partridge-sized then HOW <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> are, the hatofuls supposed to be normal bird size? or are they really BIG birds? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @RINMAKlS @belowtale I would kiss every one of those birds except for shuu <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I actually love hatoful boyfriend and am excited about holiday star, much to my absolute shock <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @belowtale ok, true, but also, you are a human, and they are literally birds, so I mean <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @belowtale you say that like a game about romancing birds isn't already bizarre? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> when I get weird on twitter, that's how you know I'm avoiding doing homework <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @RINMAKlS ok fine no more gun birds. sheesh. just trying to help out.......... <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> now he's pissed off because cabbage guy apparently established some kind of cabbage empire and wound up amounting to more than sokka <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @RINMAKlS https://t.co/EXilGSTCya <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I've asked him to keep me updated on how gay korra and asami wind up being but he's too busy being mad over sokka just not being there <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> my brother's watching legend of korra while I do homework and so far he's furious about it <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ringabel is like ryoji only 10x more obnoxious (he is still my son though) <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> why have so many random people been @-ing me lately. I don't know any of them and they're just coming out of nowhere and talking to me <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> referring to animals with the absolutely wrong name is always going to be funny to me??? "look at this weird dog!" (points at a sheep) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> usually I just want a turkey sandwich I don't have to make myself but then I feel guilty and embarrassed and add all kinds of junk <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> does anyone else ever ask for way more than they actually want when they go to subway <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> I keep missing sassy fran DANGIT <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> you wouldn't think finding a green striped shirt would be so difficult but WELL <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I don't like toriel/asgore, is what I'm saying. they were happy once but let toriel live her life ok <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I accept that pre-canon toriel and asgore were super lovey-dovey but considering how she feels later it's hard to go beyond that lol <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> and like, it's cute? and if they're kids here I'm assuming none of the Bad Stuff happened? but still <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I keep seeing his artist who does cute undertale fanart of the monsters as kids and I really like it BUT there's a lot of toriel/asgore <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ @eulerhopepunk he and sans can nap together. no angst here, just fluff <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> but honestly I wouldn't mind the hyperdeath fic becoming my new most popular one bc no offence but it's super good <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> the last fandom I was in, my most popular fic was a stupid joke fic and I was SO MAD <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @eulerhopepunk @chemiosmotic_ sans/tubbs is my guilty pleasure ship <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @RINMAKlS no??? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ @mynnths the FUCK. how will I make my mark on the world NOW <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ only now does it occur to me to ask why you were thinking about sans/burgerpants at all but I'm glad I could help either way <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> pretty sure burgerpants is secretly an invader zim character <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I regret saying this because of the mental image it provided me with but not enough to delete it <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> sans/burgerpants would be a good ship because the ship name is "sans pants" which implies that pants are never involved <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ No problem I live to serve o7 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> little did either of them know that the resort didn't actually have ketchup but MTT Brand Tomato Paste Substitute <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> little did he know that sans was only using him for unlimited ketchup access <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> "Oh sans" said the fast food cat through gritted teeth. "Something about your brittle fibulas makes me hate the world just a bit less" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ I'll write it for you <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> I'm thinking about this bc I see people talking about christians shoving christmas down their throats and I'm like...yeah <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> but, like, we've done it this long, might as well keep doing it. and it's an excuse to give presents and eat candy canes and stuff <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> so. holidays are kinda weird? because nobody in my family these days is actually christian or even particularly religious <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> my family celebrates christmas because my kokum and mushum were forcibly converted by residential schools <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> mumble grumble my name was supposed to be "whitehawk" which is cool as shit but they changed it because of ugly racists <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> for the record, I'm mixed. my father was saulteaux. but I don't look it even slightly so it feels like it doesn't count lmao <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @RINMAKlS my opinions are literally the best and you're just too wrong to even realize it <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> WHY THE FUCK DID A BRONY ACCOUNT JUST RETWEET THIS <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> no offence, but rainbow dash was the best character hands down. it's 2015 but I will fight you over this <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> now when ppl talk about bronies I just...*takes a long drag off a cigarette* I was there, you know <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> and then one day I suddenly realized how unpleasant the whole fanbase was and I just Quit <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> csa jic // there were a lot of gross older men who got super weird with me?? I won't go into details (nothing serious just creepiness) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> when I was about 15 mlp was my special interest and I had no idea how creepy the fanbase was <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I love those posts that are like "the moon is a lesbian" cuz yeah she is and I am writing about it. I already knew the truth <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @starlithorizons they're always super simple lmao, I'm no good at theory and usually just mess around until I find a melody I like <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> in my head it's the theme song for the story I'm writing about the moon goddess, it plays during all the emotional parts <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> there's this one song I wrote once and it's the prettiest song ever I wish I could record it properly and share it I love it so much <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> this sounds so pretentious I literally just mean that I never picked up much theory and don't know how to use any software <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @starlithorizons sorry <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I miss my piano. I want to write music but I can't do it with just pencil and paper or music software. I need to feel the keys <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> I should stop ranting I'm just frustrated with the entire stupid planet for not making any sense literally ever in its entire history <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @feralphoenix you're nice but also that never works in real life : / I need to get a cheat sheet or something <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> what the hell is even the point in feelings anyway. they're unnecessary. they don't WORK <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> so like I said I'm just going to. I don't know. become a tree, and not have to cope with other people's feelings anymore <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> usually it's not so frustrating!!! but today has been a day of me not understanding things and I'm tired of needing explanations <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> why do people do the shit they do? I don't fucking know. why do they feel this way or that way? I don't fucking know <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm going to live in the woods and never talk to people ever again because I don't understand anything. nothing makes any damn sense <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> when, am I going to understand what the fuck is even happening in the world. the answer is never, that's why I'm going into hiding <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> me: I think this 
someone else: well I think this 
me: oh never mind I was wrong I think that too now (fuck I'm an idiot fuck fuck god damn) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @starlithorizons: stars are ideal bc
1 they live in the void
2 theyre burning orbs of fire and energy
3 ppl use them for wishes
4 they c‚Ä¶ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I don't trust myself to form opinions bc all my opinions suck and come from a terrible place. I'm gonna play more love live <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> it's not something you reread later and go "wait that's not right" it's exactly as happy as it should be <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> anyway back to my dream novel. everyone is gay and happily in love. dragons and mermaids are there. it's exactly what it should be <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> it's not always good or healthy love but I can never actually tell I guess <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @feralphoenix The stuff she does is fucking garbage and it pisses me off because she DIDN'T HAVE TO BE WRITTEN THAT WAY <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> so when people say they love someone I cling to that because I mean that's better than being hated <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The problem is, I have no idea what good people or healthy relationships look like <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> *lies down on the floor* I have bad taste in characters and now I feel guilty <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @feralphoenix I know, homura is fucking terrible but when I watched the show I was so stupidly happy and I still feel so stupidly attached <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @NintendoInq: The upcoming Link Between Worlds Figma has been given some color! https://t.co/BTh5dRyNF3 https://t.co/2veqfcLnuH <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> *screaming even louder* I just need a conclusion <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> *screaming* just a page and a half more <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I don't really do this anymore which is nice. but it HAPPENED and it's nice to have a word for what that was now <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> and then I'd just be spacing out and not want to move or talk and my mom would be like "pls tell me if you're ok" and I'd be like "????????" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> it's so hard to describe? for me it was always my arms. my arms would feel really heavy, like they were holding something? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> fun fact about dissociation, I didn't know what it was at first and now that I do I realize I did it All The Time <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ god same I am just constantly thinking about that and I am always upset <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ I think either pronoun is probably ok since we see both being used, and it's hard to say given the circumstances <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ bc like I said, that's what asriel used, and I feel like he of all people would know? (it's possible he was assuming tho) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ since there's never a point where chara says "use these pronouns" I think it's probably safest to go with "they" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ like. the way people will call a cat or a dog an "it" if they're not super good with animals <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ hmm, that's a good point. but I'd actually interpreted that as monsters not really knowing how to deal with humans? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ asriel knew them best and uses they/them so I think that's what they'd have preferred/used most of the time <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ I personally hc chara as having issues with depersonalization but I don't think they'd use it/its normally, just when upset <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ are you just considering them in general or did you see somebody using them and are trying to work out how you feel? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @lumalees the lockstep at the beginning is just so "ahhhhhhhhhh" feeling <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> anyway I really like this one https://t.co/ToFx8W0KoU <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ but if someone isn't like that and you can't actually play the game then...no point, none at all <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ I like them cuz I find them super stimmy to listen to? like, hearing all the stuff in rhythm is super satisfying to me <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ there's not really a point tbh like it's not as though you can actually play the games show in the video <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ which one are you listening to. if it's the one I'm thinking of the same person also did a megalovania one that I like <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I asked my girlfriend if bowser was hot and she said "luigi is hotter" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ the wages of sin is sexy bowser fanart <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> in other news, I found this from when I used to actually have a bowser tag, and it's cute https://t.co/q1iBywFHVu <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I was lying I am running out of bowser pics and I refuse to actually look up "sexy bowser" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @RINMAKlS I can do this all day https://t.co/LXuwRQHOK0 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @RINMAKlS let him seduce u https://t.co/YUZqX2kKZk <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> you: bowser's not hot!!

<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ @RINMAKlS what's going on is, bowser is hot, and courtney can't accept it <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @starlithorizons YES!!!! YOU'RE RIGHT. I'll make rosalina proud!! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> page 8/10. I just need two more. I can do this. I can totally do this (why did I put off doing my term paper until the night before WHY) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> *resumes building my turn-amiibos-into-real-people machine* <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> *thinks about rosalina* *turns to my amiibo and sheds a single tear* soon, my love...........soon we will be together................... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> (if I had to pick a mario character to date it would be rosalina and I'd propose on the spot) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ that's nto a real thing. I looked it up and it is oh my god <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @RINMAKlS um??? he's big??? he's a family man??????? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @RINMAKlS you can't ground me you're not my real mom <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> for the record I am not a furry. bowser is hot but thinking that doesn't make me a furry because he's a lizard. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> there's also a secret king boo route <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @RINMAKlS write ur own damn dating sim (please include a rosalina route) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> protagonist is luigi <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @RINMAKlS: @lumalees callout post for shaylyn:

-wants a mario dating sim <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> routes include:
-bowser
-waluigi
-prince peasley
-kamek
-a thwomp <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ nintendo hire me to write a mario dating sim <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> that is definitely not what I'm saying I swear <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> wait am I saying I want a mario visual novel <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> like, there's a lot of banter, and I like that, it's cute. the actual games are just alright but I like seeing the characters be silly <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> the thing about the mario &amp; luigi games, is, they're not that great, but they're funny, so. I'm satisfied <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @RINMAKlS he has to fucking earn it ok he's not allowed to die out with sticker star having been his last game OK <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> *slams my head into a desk* stop talking abuot mario you have work to do <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> look at his. it's luigi. only he's fucking huge. how can you not love a giant luigi https://t.co/xRRTkBOAik <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> anyone: sticker star was bad
me: fair point but in dream team you can have a thousand luigis onscreen at once and fuse into a giant luigi <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @RINMAKlS u need...to move on...and learn to love again <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> *presses hands over my ears* lalalala ooh papercraft battles that sounds neat haha <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @RINMAKlS *starts sweating nervously* that was...that was just...I... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> look. if nothing else. this game will be funny. at least let me have that. the mario rpgs are always really funny ok. ok?? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @RINMAKlS they won't be dead if you Believe and I personally believe wholeheartedly that this one will be Good <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @RINMAKlS YOU ARE THE ONE WHO IS KILLING THEM BY SAYING THAT <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> my horoscope today: "much, we are told in life, comes in 'threes'. ???????????? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ok anyway. back to this fuckening paper. if I get it done then I'm allowed to play more antai <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> paper jam will be good because it has the koopalings and bowser being an awkward dad <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> dream team was good because it was about luigi and you got to go in luigi's subconscious which was as surreal and depressing as it sounds <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @RINMAKlS @chemiosmotic_ FRICK OFF!!!!! the new one is going to be GOOD just like dream team was GOOD, don't spread your goddamn lies <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ IT'S GOING FINE!!!! MARIO RPGS ARE FUN AND THE NEW ONE IS GOING TO BE SUPER GOOD NO MATTER WHAT ANYONE SAYS <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm just listening to the paper jam music and tbh the whole soundtrack is a little Much (I still like it though) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @RINMAKlS I'll be sure to tell you how GOOD and FUN IT IS!!!! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I DON'T CARE WHAT ANYONE SAYS I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO PAPER JAM. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> it is absolutely a little melodramatic but wtf do you expect when you ask the kingdom hearts lady to compose for your mario game <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> (even if it's kind of way too fucking dramatic for a mario game) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> listen. listen. have doubts about paper jam all you want. this is still a good song https://t.co/T15oyvdlka <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ Um. shrug? I didn't think very far about this whoops <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ I don't think so but I feel like it should be grey/white for a blank slate kinda feel <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> U know that dub of that ponyo comic? "Ponyo loves...ham!!! Ponyo loves...sousuke!!!!!! Ponyo loves...REVOLUTION" that's chara <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> red text is chara's Dramatic Voice it's canon now <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> *super excited* ah!!! whoa!!!!! wow!!!!!!! it's a *suddenly deadpan* hole <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Doesn't the text go red in the "ah! Whoa! Wow! It's a hole" dialogue? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ chara is an angel honestly and I hope that's what the red text is bc it makes me happy to think about it <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ Not necessarily an emotion thing just. Being really grave I guess <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ like the "ball game" thing seemed like a joke to me, with chara being faux-serious <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ when else does it appear? I always just assumed it indicated intensity <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @starlithorizons lol basically...it's honestly way easier to just ignore it, you're not missing anything. it was unnecessary <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ YEAH exactly. homura loving madoka and being severely emotionally scarred by her deaths = Being The Literal Devil I guess <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I refuse to be angry about rebellion story in this the year of our lord 2015. I'm taking a stand <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> rebellion was just like "haha look at this poor stupid traumatized girl, her love is Selfish and Wrong and she is Bad" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> homura was so good?? and the original anime was pretty ok as a standalone thing? but rebellion <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @starlithorizons I'm trying my best to ignore it too bc homura was such a good character and then they were like "lol screw that" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @RINMAKlS SAME LMAO but my asshole friends all thought it was funny that homura became a villain when I defended her so much before <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> it was the fucking worst and it ruined my favourite character for me and now I hate the entire franchise <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I used to like homura so much and now everything is garbage <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I really doubt this new movie series will be improving my opinion of shaft and urobuchi at all <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I used to really like madoka magica despite how shitty it could be but now I'm bitter over rebellion story <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> more mami though...that's good <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> just let it die https://t.co/Q4wbdJcqfh <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> this marx btw. not, like, karl marx https://t.co/NQG2vkeTu8 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ there definitely aren't but I love it so much. SO MUCH <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> he reminds me of marx how can I not love him <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> lrt; I LOVE THAT INTERPRETATION OF HUMANIZED FLOWEY????? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @SKBsu: @undertale_ntbr Êì¨‰∫∫Âåñ„ÄÄ#undertale https://t.co/iPgTff2rnA <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ frisk, pls come to my house, I will make you dinner. I mean I can't cook but I can make your instant noodles for you <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ oh god now I'm sad. I'm sorry frisk. I'ms orry <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> an important question: can frisk actually make spaghetti, or were they...a liar?!?!?!?! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ok......ok. back to work <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I love alraia, bc she's like the physical embodiment of " =) *that's me screaming with my mouth closed " <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> at first they're mad bc wtf they trusted her. but nah this guy needs his ass kicked. so ok <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> alraia tries to convince them they're gonna save the world, but, they're not. she just wants them to help beat the shit out of someone <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ok I'm done talking about my ocs I just wanted a break from essay-writing <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> they're all cool friends and are on a journey to fucking kick someone's ass (NOT AN EXAGGERATION) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> shani = spoilers and also basically an angry ninja. nobody likes her. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> also 
airis = a pirate, flirty and loud, everyone loves her 
tila = baby-faced alcoholic dancer, everyone loves her <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> sorry valety <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> valety is my fav bc she's a knight and is all stoic and deadpan and is in unrequited love with her friend. but she's not the protagonist <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> for reference
alraia = passive-aggressive moon goddess
elli = her incredibly anxious priestess 
valety = elli's cool and autistic friend <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> and if anybody ships alraia with her abuser the way I'm scared they might I will send this planet into the fucking abyss <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> you're allowed to ship valety--&gt;elli bc that's canon but?? it's not gonna happen, sorry <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> anyone those are the canon sexualities and genders of my ocs. when you read my book someday KEEP THOSE IN MIND <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> tila is a pansexual aromantic trans girl and she's qpp with shani who's an aro-ace demigirl <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> valety is agender and bi, airis is a pansexual trans girl, they too are in love and it's the second most canon of my oc ships <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> alraia is a nb asexual lesbian. elli is a demiromantic ace. they're in love and it's great. it's the most canon ship of all <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> the romance won't necessarily be explicit but everyone is going to have canon sexualities and genders and love interests ok <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> a fear: if I ever actually finish my book and get it published someday, people will ship All The Wrong Things <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @undertale_bot: HUMAN.
ALLOW ME TO TELL YOU ABOUT SOME COMPLEX FEELINGS.
FEELINGS LIKE. . .
THE JOY OF FINDING ANOTHER PASTA LOVER. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> don't put yourself out or anything if you don't wanna think about it, it's just that I lost my old blacklist and can't remember everyone <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> if, people happen to know offhand the names of any artists I should block, that might be helpful. I can't keep track of them all <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> *lies down* I am 20 years old and I still feel like a stupid naive idiot baby who doesn't know a single goddamn about the world <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm hoping I can learn to recognize it but it's sad that I have to lmao it's not something I want to be a part of even slightly <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> now *I'm* the adult and I have to try really, really hard not to accidentally contribute to that kind of thing <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I still don't get it most of the time, it's just not the way I think, but I'm trying to be careful, I don't want to hurt anyone <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> and I honestly had no clue, I didn't get any of it, but now in retrospect I realize how awful so many of them were <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> god I remember when I was like 14-15 I was really into mlp and there were so many fucking gross-ass adults who were disgusting towards me <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @belowtale YEAH I've seen those around...like at least that's something even I can pick up on as being Nasty <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KeltenaAsule it was supposed to be scary, with Literal Demon Chara, and frisk was supposed to be terrified of having seen them <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KeltenaAsule like!! I thought it was a sad thing, bc *I* would have thought it was a sad thing, but then I looked at it again and nope <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KeltenaAsule and at the end frisk is upset?? and when I saw it I thought "how sad frisk can see what they were like before they died :c" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KeltenaAsule yEAH...I remember there was a creepyknees coming going around before where the lens cap wasn't on for the tapes?? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> anyway I continue to not fucking Understand the world but what else is new. what else is goddamn new <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> THEY WERE CLIMBING A MOUNTAIN!!! WHY WOULD I THINK IT WAS A SEX SCENE!!!!!!!!! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KeltenaAsule YEAH!!! and bc I sympathize with them I always think "oh no how sad" and then I found out it was supposed to be Scary <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm getting pissed off bc I'm remembering this english class and how a scene of them climbing a mountain was apparently a metaphor for sex <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> if a character isn't outright naked and/or having sex, it's hard to tell if it's supposed to be sexy, y'know??? why would I assume it IS???? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I dunno!!!! it's just hard. I don't understand people, nobody makes any fucking sense, just come right out and say what you mean <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> so when I see the bad stuff in fan art it can be hard to tell if it's just fanart or if it's someone trying to celebrate or sexualize it <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> suicide mention// I mean, chara does, in fact, canonically like knives and canonically committed suicide. lots of bad stuff happened <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KeltenaAsule with chara fanart, if they're not literally stabbing someone it's hard for me to tell if it's something bad <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KeltenaAsule if there's no obvious reason for me to think it's something negative I tend not to realize <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KeltenaAsule yeah, that's kind of my problem. I'm not good at picking up on people's intentions. it's hard to tell if they're benign or not <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ok...ok...I am definitely signing off twitter now. throw a shoe at me if I post anything else <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> like I see fanart of chara and I think "there is my child" and then later I find out it's from someone who hates them and is into guro <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> 90% of the time me accidentally reblogging something weird or from someone bad is bc I just assume it's innocent cuz why wouldn't it be <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I dunno I'm just not observant so I'm sorry if I ever make you see something uncomfortable bc odds are I. just wasn't thinking. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I don't want to totally abdicate all responsibility, I want to try and be responsible, but also sometimes I really can't tell <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> so if I ever reblog/rt something iffy I'd appreciate it if someone mentions it, and also, I'm sorry in advance <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> on a serious note, I'm, really bad at picking up on creepy stuff? sometimes I get a bad feeling but don't really recognize or understand it <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> all there is is music and light and when ppl try to bother me I blast them with a hyperbeam <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> in an alternate universe I am a space mermaid who swims around in an ocean of stars all day and never talks to anybody ever <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> things I would be if I could:
-a mermaid
-a star
-a robot

things I am not:
-a good student
-even remotely productive <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ *gently takes you by the hand and leads you away* it's not worth it...you don't have to do this to yourself <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> things I'm super into:
-water
-stars
-robots

things I'm not super into:
-doing my hw
-right now
-hw I should be doing at this very moment <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> *remembers their are people who want to fuck robots* god dammit <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> humans suck, that's why I'm going to have my consciousness transferred into a robot and then I'll be free from ppl being gross forever <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ ugh yeah...I hate it, I hate it so much, ppl find violent behaviour "sexy" but ppl with violent impulses are Bad and Scary <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> anyway when I was ten I thought this was the most beautiful song in the world. https://t.co/j8S5dfzUZK <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> moreso than I already did, I mean <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> shit like this is almost definitely exactly why chara wanted to destroy humanity bc it's making ME want to destroy humanity <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> some ppl just seem to find violence...fetishy? and then they project it onto chara, and it's just so creepy <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I wish I could articulate my thoughts on the matter better, but I don't really know how lol <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ yeah, I've noticed that too?? I seriously don't understand it <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ but they seem too, uh, interested in seeing them be creepy and blood-stained? kind of? even though it's not blatantly sexual? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ it reminds me of ppl who are really into yanderes, even though chara's not exactly one of those <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ I think I know what you mean actually?? like I don't really get it, but I've received the same impression <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> what am I doing. I gotta do my homework <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> anyway it was good and theo was a good oc, she was very autistic and I think she had purple hair for some reason <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> so they married for show but they each were totally still dating the people they actually liked and it was cool <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> and the princess got to be gay cuz the prince was in love with the knight's trans sister anyway <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> a bunch of stuff happened but it ended happily and the knight and dragon got together <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> and the dragon had "kidnapped" her so she could run away with her cool lady bodyguard <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> but it turned out the dragon and the princess had a deal cuz the princess didn't want to marry the prince she was engaged to <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> the knight's name was theo and she went to save a princess from a dragon called smoke <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I remember actually writing a story like that back in high school now that I think about it. I should try to find it <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ It will be the best book you've ever read I Promise <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> also their will be dragons, and lots of swords, and a million pretty girls. please read my book when it comes out <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> someday I am going to write a fantasy novel about butch lesbian knights who are all asexual <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> in the meantime I'll just aggressively admire the characters who best resemble my Ideal Self <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> this is never going to happen because I'm wimpy but I can Dream <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> my dream in life is to somehow become really cool and strong and butch and have short hair <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> All of my favourite characters are ace for the record that's just how it is (sorry) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> good cuz that doesn't mean I can't be her friend and learn how to be cool like her <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> she's so cool I can't wait to find out what she does wrong <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> also, re teagan: üòçüòçüòç <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I've reached metronome tower, time to do homework <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I LOVE MEDLEY FESTIVAL IT MAKES ME FEEL SO POWERFUL https://t.co/udKOB0WcKZ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> why the fuck has the air been smoky lately. there were forest fires in the summer but nothing like that has been happening lately so??? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I know this is random but this is still my favourite rpg town theme ever https://t.co/VJ3Bxy1Tyq <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> everytime I see that post about pta sans telling linda her stale-ass brownies have bofa I want to c ry bc I always forget the punchline <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> (Eye horror tw) I love this post?? bc it's literally 100% true I can confirm that https://t.co/ie0wDPZTXN <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> *bursts into tears* asriel just loves chara so much <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @meyecy he eats all the gotdanm food what are the other cats supposed to eat...,. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Have this picture of my cat instead (that's my hand) https://t.co/Ua4RNtfG8f <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> sometimes I want to post pictures of myself but then I remember that I'm ugly and unphotogenic <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> sOMEBODY GET ME SOME CHOCOLATE PLEASE <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> what kind of chocolate would chara like best. I've always pictured them liking really sweet creamy stuff. in fact they'd like caramilks <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @belowtale a good au <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I would sell my firstborn child for a caramilk bar right now <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> if you're american you probably haven't seen this commercial before?? please do yourself a favour https://t.co/QlD5RCXARe <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> chara with cats...not bad...not bad at all <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @JotaroKakyoin: please.... im tired of seeing osomatsu.... theyre like minions but for anime <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm a bad person and have intentionally been trying to spoil antai for myself but it's shockingly hard so I have no idea what's coming <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KeltenaAsule i'M SO EXCITED TO SEE THEM <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KeltenaAsule AHHHHHHH <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> but still I saw a post talking about undyne and undines like it was some kind of goddamn revelation <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @starlithorizons Ok I guess it IS kind of odd that her name is undyne...like if my name was hyuman <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> that's just...a thing. it's just the kind of monster she is <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> they're probably not exactly common knowledge I guess but I mean it's not like it's particularly clever to have undyne be a fish lady <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> did people...not...already know what undines were? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> also, she should absolutely wear suits <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> but I don't care I want to be her friend <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> apparently she. does something? a bad thing? I dunno what, I just remember someone joking about her being problematic or something <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> btw teagan is the most attractive of the antais <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm thinking about...my ocs.......I love them <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> chara: *eating right out of the thing* this is so wild you're so fucked up for making me do this <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> chara: *shaking their head and chuckling* i cant believe you're making me do this
asriel: I'm not <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> chara: haha hey do u dare me to eat this whole thing of chocolate ice cream
asriel: no <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> AUBREY IS CUTE....... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> bluh I keep waking up feeling sick in the morning. what the fuck <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Conversations with my mom https://t.co/yCDv0xJXsw <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> my chest feels all tight I'd better not be getting asthma-y again <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> *cannon noises* <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> duh duh DUH duh duh duh DUH duh duuuuh, duh duh DUH duh duh duh DUh duh duuuuh <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I've been listening to the 1812 overture on repeat for the past two hours and I'm not tired of it yet <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> To clarify I am smiling fondly as I wipe away a tear I am not somehow using a smile to wipe away tears <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @simplycarryon YES exactly...like father like son *wipes away a tear with a fond smile* <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It's like asgore in the true ending only instead of undyne laughing at him it's chara swatting asriel with a rolled up newspaper <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ok I gotta stop and focus on work now <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> asriel: uh frisk I just want you to know that I'm not sorry for trying to kill you 
frisk:
chara: we literally just talked about this <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> asriel: should I. should I try to kill them again, then? would that...would that help?
chara: ok stop <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> chara: even if you do it's probably fine everyone they know has tried to kill them before so it's basically a prerequisite for friendship <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> asriel: are you sure 
chara: yeah I mean just don't try to kill them and it'll probably be fine <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> asriel: I think frisk hates me
chara: no it's cool I literally lived inside of their body for a while and they seemed all right with you <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> now I'm imagining chara as their mediator. chara, the one holding the group together. we love you chara <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> frisk is a good kid but they would be totally justified in being a tiny bit wary around asriel?? and asriel would probably feel. Bad <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I dunno what my point is, probably just that chara needs to be more involved with frisk + asriel interactions cuz HOW ELSE SO THEY WORK <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> so. I mean. things would be awkward for a while <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> but also, frisk first knew asriel as flowey, then as a death god trying to kill them into complacency, then only VERY BRIEFLY as himself <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> afterwards, sure, it was very emotional and I totally get them being friends in an au and all that jazz. I love them together <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> people need to remember that frisk literally only interacted with asriel in a "this goat is trying to kill me" way <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> my chest hurts and I feel like I'm going to die but I'm a model student <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I feel like I'm going to throw up?? but I need to get my shit together I have too much to do to be panicking right now <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I might be having a panic attack over homework this is fun <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> just started crying in the library because of how much work I have to do...cool...that's cool <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @RINMAKlS Also, I played so many ecchi games and dating sims. But it was for the story I swear <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @RINMAKlS LMAO SAME <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KeltenaAsule Thank you! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm very nervous because bad times are almost definitely coming <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I am enjoying antai so far <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KeltenaAsule THEY'RE GOING TO FINISH IT!!! THEY'RE JUST TAKING A BREAK!!!!!!! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KeltenaAsule YEAH I'm curious about the ones I missed <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @simplycarryon @KeltenaAsule I JUSY GOT TO THAT ONE <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KeltenaAsule I just got to wadanohara and dept. heaven...this is such a cute detail <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> but I'm pretty sure it has ib and the grey garden <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> are all the fiction books in the libretto library references to games? I didn't pick up on it at first <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @ooc_yuri: https://t.co/Hzcg6v2i1O <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> if I ever changed my name it would need to start with an L, L is my favourite letter <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> btw in case you are pronouncing it wrong in your head: shay-lin, short I sound. not shayleen or shayline <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> work is done. plans for tonight: 
-antai over dinner 
-homework (so many essays and take home exams ahhhhhh) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> first name basis...how forward!! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I c an't explain it it just seems too  personal somehow <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KeltenaAsule Look. Look. My name is cute as hell. But it feels downright bizarre for people to CALL me that. It's too much <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @Iovewing: prince honoka: the otome game https://t.co/zmS7CaeI3l <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> anyway I just wanna say that I wish I had a cute internet nickname but it's super weird trying to be anything but shaylyn <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm feeling kind of better now I think? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I might be quiet for a bit <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm feeling kind of. nonverbal today. I thought it was just talking out loud but typing and maintaining conversations is hard  rn <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> like even if it's kinda out of character I lose my shit every time I see a post about him destroying some off-screen linda <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> pta sans will never not be funny tbh <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Big time fucko can be my undertale shitpost tag <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> but "chara tag" and "asriel tag" are boring so I need to think of something else I can use <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ For now I'm just using the "____ tag" format until I can think of something better <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> fun fact about me that may take you by surprise: chara is good and I like them <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ I Will Not Allow My Blog To Become A Laughingstock <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm super tempted to make my chara tag either ball game or big time fucko. I must resist <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm bored at work so I'm gonna try going through my entire undertale tag in order to clean it up <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ !!!!! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> like even if there were only 10 hits outside of me checking them, that's 10 times someone wanted to read something I wrote :') <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> sometimes I check my fics for comments/kudos and realize that all those hits are how many times someone has read them and I get so happy <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Made it to libretto, and now I gotta stop and get ready for work <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KeltenaAsule Honestly thank god for wordy people with good opinions cuz it leaves me free to nod and point at them emphatically <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KeltenaAsule My brain isn't working today so I don't have much to add but basically I agree completely so A++ to you <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KeltenaAsule Cuz then they think they've done GOOD and don't have to try anymore lol <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KeltenaAsule Headcanons are fine, I like those, I just don't think creators deserve as much credit as they get sometimes <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> alto and teagan are cute I can't wait to have my impressions of them fucked with <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I gave in and started uncommon time, but I probably won't get far cuz I work in an hour <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KeltenaAsule I haven't played the sequel but I think giving it credit for anything like this is a bit Much <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @moonlightcougar: A group of tornadoes around Inola, Oklahoma last night https://t.co/OZDsSM1W5u <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> A character crossdressing is almost definitely the creator being gross and thinking it's funny/hot not trying to include a gnc character <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> like, 9 times outta 10, characters people refer to as good representation in anime/VNs are jokes, or fetishized, or just not great lol <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ That kinda thing. But I haven't finished it so who knows maybe it's actually Great with this stuff <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ it's more like "it's funny if this character falls asleep all the time" not "this can be positive narcoleptic representation" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ it's true that characters are shown to have issues but it sure as fuck doesn't come across as trying to be inclusive <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ Hatoful is not exactly what I'd call good disability representation lmao <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> sakuryou is...good <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @RINMAKlS sakuya is a good egg. he is trying his best and I love him for it <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @RINMAKlS I CARE ABOUT SAKUYA SO MUCH...I wasn't expecting to but he's been so fucked up and I need him to be ok <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @belowtale oh no.......oh  n o <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I can't believe I'm listening to an actual anime voice actor read asriel's anime oc battle monologue <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> it's 2015 and I've been memed on by ishimaru <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @RINMAKlS FUCK I'm suddenly remembering this one post I saw where he said something about getting memed on in his ishimaru voice...fucl <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ishimaru was always one of my favourite dangans I'm glad his voice actor is cool <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @RINMAKlS DID HE REALLY OMFG <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @belowtale I started bbl and couldn't play very long but I got to the sakuya and yuuya stuff in. 5th class I think? and I am Upset <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> they're not. bad? like, I'm not making fun of him or anything? it's just so fucking funny to me that ishimaru voices papyrus for fun <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> also does undertale voices apparently https://t.co/VlF15F4gGV <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm going to bed pretty soon, but I just wanted everyone to know, that the guy who does the english voice for ishimaru in dangan ronpa <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ok...I gotta stop with the hatoful for now... but god damn <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> SAKUYA.....YUUYA......... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KeltenaAsule I'm getting so into the story that I'm literally not even thinking about how weird this is anymore...and then I remember <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> please protect anghel <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm, slow with RPGs, so sorry in advance for how long it will take me to get anywhere. but I'm excited to check it out <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> oh btw I downloaded uncommon time...I wanna play that after I'm done with hatoful <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I keep forgetting that these are birds???? even though they're right on screen??????? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS SCARECROW <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @RINMAKlS IT'S NOT FINE??? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> wtf is happening in hatoful. people are dying. why are these birds committing murder <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> more hatoful, then I can be sad about birds instead <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> sigh now I feel sad about height <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @feralphoenix you have fantastic ideas honestly I'll get the matches <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I just!! really wish ppl in my life wanted to take care of me the way they expect me to take care of others, I guess <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I guess it isn't actually that big a deal haha <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> and now, I'm really weak and get sick a lot and am just generally frail and people think I should be commanding and powerful or w/e <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> we go on a field trip, ppl ask me to be in charge of a group, I dunno wtf to do, I'm a kid too, but ppl forget <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> and I'm not exaggerating like ppl literally assumed I was in my twenties in fifth grade or so and expected me to watch my classmates <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ever since I was like 10 there's been pressure to be the leader and to take care of everyone when I really wanted to be taken care of <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> and I feel really fragile a lot? and in need of direction? but people always think I should be able to take care of everything <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I feel like I never really got to be a child in the eyes of strangers bc they always assumed I was an adult who could handle everything lol <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @RINMAKlS Agreed <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @feralphoenix a trade, excellent, you may have an entire foot of height, I do not want it <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> new topic: why is shuu's theme dance of the sugar plum fairy? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> so people EXPECT THINGS <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm the stereotype of the timid, asthmatic librarian only I'm a broad-shouldered giant whose default expression is a frown <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> another downside of height: people think you're strong?? and ask you to carry things??? but I'm weak af and have so many health problems <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> THE POINT IS!!! my gf is Small <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @RINMAKlS IT'S NOT GOOD...people always think you're in Charge somehow and ask if you play basketball <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> on the inside I'm a shy, anxious baby BUT NOBODY BELIEVES ME bc I'm so big and look solid or something I guess <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I hate being tall because I always look huge and intimidating and ppl have thought I was an adult since I was 12 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @RINMAKlS YOU DON'T <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @feralphoenix ?? of me being a giant or having a tiny girlfriend??? being tall is the WORST and a tiny gf is a big responsibility u know <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> thank goodness tho cuz when we meet in person I will absolutely have to carry her dramatically at least once and it's easier if she's smol <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> well I mean I already knew but I hadn't realized how much smaller than me 5"2 is (I'm 6"0) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> today I found out that my gf is short...REALLY short...I can't believe <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @meyecy I gotta go for a bit but I'm looking forward to reading anything else you come up with when I get back!! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @meyecy I think so? It seems natural. No way chara wouldn't have the magic knife tho <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> papyrus with a very small, energetic puppy daemon. muffet with a tarantula <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> frisk with a pygmy goat daemon though.,.,,,I'm dying that's so good <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> "It was grotesque, but it's not like it was a dead bird" uhhh <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @meyecy all I really have so far is, that asriel gets severed and that's how he becomes flowey <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @meyecy YES!!!! Y ES <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> hatoful boyfriend is so fucked up <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @meyecy it's been ages since I've read those books properly so I'm just shrugging here but it would be a REALLy COOL AU <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @meyecy HELLO!!! any suggestions for what the ut characters would have as their daemons in a his dark materials au? I need help with that <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'M DONE WORK TIME FOR THE BBL ROUTE <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ iT'S PERFECT <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> chara's daemon should be a cat. just saying <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ASRIEL GETS HIS DAEMON SEVERED AND BECOMES FLOWEY <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Chara finds the knife somehow and travels to the other world and gets a daemon of their own and...and that's all I have so far <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> two universes then, the underground characters with their daemons from one, Frisk and chara from the other <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> even odder to have one that's not <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm envisioning this as being a human au tbh. like, it seems odd to have a goat with a daemon that's also a goat <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KeltenaAsule YEAH THAT'S WHAT I WAs THINKING. it wouldn't share the actual plot of HDM at all but it share these elements <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KeltenaAsule Literally all I care about is figuring out which daemon suits everyone best so I'm not worrying about the logistics <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KeltenaAsule I remember will having a magic knife and being a human who gets a daemon, so. Chara?? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KeltenaAsule I'm not sure it's been a while since I read HDM. maybe monsters can be from the world with daemons and humans aren't? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> remind me to bring this up again when feral's around she's good with symbolism in aus and I need to know about everyone's daemons <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @KeltenaAsule I'm listening to my iPod at work and this one monogatari opening came on and suddenly I feel like it's a chara song??? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> do you ever just mentally totally divorce a song from all context and wind up associating it with someone/something you probably shouldn't <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'M LAUGHIGN AT WORK ABOUT ASS BEES <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @belowtale: Greetings.
I am Ass Bees.
The demon that comes when people call it's n <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ok back to ass bees. actually nm all I can think to say about those is "what kind of honey would they produce." time for me to stop <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> too many bad memories associated with Fancy things <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> oh also that's part of why my chara doesn't actually want to rule the underground or be an ambassador. too suffocating <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> that sort of came out of nowhere but anyway that is my random chara headcanon for the day <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> hence the way they talk in the no mercy ending, bc god damn are they mad at you (the player) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> but they default to a big smile + formal language + overly pleasant behaviour when unhappy/angry <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> when they're actually able to relax and feel safe with the dreemurrs they like to be messy and rude and cranky bc they CAN be <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> and now laughing + smiling is just sort of instinctive for them when upset cuz otherwise they'll get in trouble <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> a super controlling, repressed household where they weren't allowed to visibly show distress or anger, that kind of thing <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> and I see the laughing/smiling thing as a side effect of that? like they were expected to keep up appearances <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @bigtimefucko: Ass Bees <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm not sure why but I hc chara as having come from a """nice""" family <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ jon arbuckle is a careless pet owner who does not deserve his bees <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> how do you just forget about ass bees <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ If he DOES make a habit of carrying bees around then that begs the question, why is he so surprised by them <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> jon arbuckle is gross and the comic strip garfield is now rated a hard R <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ I don't even know and I'm so angry about it. bees maybe? does he often carry jars of angry bees around in his back pocket? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> and asked if Jon often leaves his phone in his "inventory", and now I refuse to talk about butts anymore <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> and how ppl don't know how else to interpret other than "Jon forgot his vibrator" and he asked how he'd get those confused <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> context: I showed him that Garfield comic going around with Jon thinking his phone is vibrating in his pocket when it's on the table <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ So he now makes gross jokes about the butt area being people's inventories and...yeah...yeah <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ he likes the Sam &amp; max games and there's a joke about how this one character's inventory is some kinda hyperspace behind him <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ YES HE'S JUST WEIRD <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ God please make my brother stop referring to his ass as his "inventory" <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> I love kirby gijinkas because people always make them look way fancier and more dramatic than they need to be <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> FOR THE RECORD I LOVE META KNIGHT AND WOULD SMOOCH HIM EVEN THOUGH HE'S OLD <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ He's the really edgy orb from the Kirby series who tries super hard to act like he belongs in a serious video game franchise <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I was going to say something about how they may be short but he is doing his best but I mean I guess that's unnecessary now <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> he just is though, that's just a fact. don't believe me? it's right there in the wiki. "endearing." <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ Listen. There are some real sick folks out there and I wouldn't put it past them to Not find asriel the cutest of buttons <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I like how the undertale wiki specifically refers to asriel's fangs as "endearing". not finding them cute is noncanonical <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I say that a lot but I swear to god I'm really gonna do that someday and you can't stop me <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ why does it exist at all...I'm throwing this planet directly into the sun <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> why. Why am I so concerned about this <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @belowtale I can't sleep I need to think about sans sleeping <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> and frisk can gain an extra 10 hp at the inn after only a few minutes, so, fuck, imagine how much sans can gain in a night <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I might be remembering that wrong but w/e the point is he sleeps fucking constantly <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> and papyrus phrases it as a recent thing I think? doesn't he say something about how much sans has been "napping" LATELY? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> we all thought "wow papyrus pushes himself too hard" but?? They're skeletons???? So why WOULD they need to sleep <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> OK I LIED AGAIN BC PAPYRUS SAYS HE DOESN'T SLEEP BUT SANS DOES FOR EIGHT HOURS A NIGHT <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I really do have to go to bed now but this is going to haunt me <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> does he. does he sleep all the time in anticipation of a no mercy run <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> like yeah he's lazy and we know he has depression but he's ALSO aware of the timelines to an extent <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ok I lied about going to bed because. does sans sleep all the time on purpose??? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Now I'm just sitting here thinking "of course. Of course. Of course. Of course" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @feralphoenix like it's so Fucking simple and yet this is the first time I've seen anyone mention it <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ I'm just so used to she/her that I don't think I could change but I'd really love not to be seen as a Girl despite that <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> anyway...enough gender. Back to birds <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ *did, sorry, autocorrect <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ God I'm jealous that's never happened to me but I wish it didn't <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Like, I like she/her pronouns. But I wish people didn't assume stuff. I wish it wasn't something I had to think about at all honestly <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm definitely more female than male for the most part but some days I'm Not and I really wouldn't mind looking more. Ambiguous <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> unrelated love live opinion but nozomi looks better with the dying anime mom hair than the pigtails <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_  I feel like it has something to do with how strongly I project onto chara but I mean who knows (handwaves) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ pls tell me what the 1 good one is <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ yeah I totally get that!! it's kind of weird how I don't feel the same way about it actually... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> what if I'm missing something really good. what if someone's finally posted the sans/reader fic of my dreams <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I've haven't really been paying attention to ao3 lately I just follow a handful of authors and read all their new stuff <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ YEAH like if half the fanbase thinks he could be their father it just seems.......odd. Not THAT big a deal I guess? But. Yeah <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ anyway, him as a lab partner appears to be the default setting for that ship, but I don't ship it, so I go faaaar away <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ what we see more is probably a matter of the kind of people we follow I guess? I. Probably follow bad people lol <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ if I'm being totally honest here when I say "I see ppl hc him as a lab partner" what I mean is "they ship him with sans" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ I only prefer skeledad cuz I love thinking about baby bones family dynamics it's so cute <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ I personally prefer skeledad, but so many people hc lab partner that I just roll with it at this point <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I can either get dinner early or play a tiny bit more hatoful boyfriend hmmm I'm gonna date a pigeon <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ It makes like no sense but it's a neat idea so I just ignore logic <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I kind of like that?? but I think I like skeledad gaster best (I'm not opposed to brother/lab partner/etc gaster though) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I dunno who I think gaster is but I read a hc once that theorized that his role changes with each reset due to his precarious existence <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> and now the ultimate parenting begins <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ asgore/gaster is probably best if you hc gaster as the father of the skelebros. dadshipping <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ I never even considered that...hmm ok well maybe asgore/gaster could be good <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I love asgore but I also make fun of him a lot bc I'm a bad person and get frustrated when people ship him with toriel post-canon <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I fell asleep in class but I'm pretty sure nobody noticed üëç <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ there are no good asgore ships, also there are toriel ships that are all right imo but I know you don't like them so no <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I love how everyone just responded with some variation of "soon". Anyway I joined the library staff <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I have like 15 minutes before class so I'm starting hatoful boyfriend and I don't really see where the Sad is yet but I'm ready <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> this absolutely 100% stems from my own never-ending desire for physical affection <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> bury me in fanart and fanfic of characters being affectionate with the ones they love <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> things that kill me every gotdanm time: characters being tender with each other, characters being sweet with each other, LOVE LOVE LOVE <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> will I ever write anything other than plotless chara + asriel? sources say "no" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @RINMAKlS then.......I have done my job well............. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> anyway yeah that's why they prefer to just kind of chill and look out for asriel but not officially Do anything <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> fuck I'm sorry I'm laughing now at "what if they forget to feed it" I'm hilarious <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> too much responsibility. what if something goes wrong. what if they forget to feed it <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> for the record as much as I love the thought of chara helping rule the underground someday I think it would terrify them <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @feralphoenix :3c <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> *gets paid* *buys literally all of the apples in the grocery store* <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ GOD ME TOO. I'm positive I have actually done that on multiple occasions actually <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @feralphoenix older chara has managed to chill out a lot and is now very mushy <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> anyway it's now 11 am and I should probably eat something other than these plums I bought last night <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> besides this fic seems like it's gonna build up to be approximately what I REALLY REALLY want https://t.co/KKoQIVHSDD <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> like, for just a tiny little scene I mean <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm sad that I couldn't work up the motivation to do a proper longfic for this au cuz I love thinking about it but I think I did Okay <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> here u go a charasriel fic that I literally could not think of a title for https://t.co/lzqNwPTmwi <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> WHOA HERE WE ARE THIS IS IT <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ppl always talk about buying and eating an entire cake but for me it's literally just gorging myself on fruit <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> so far my favourite thing about being an adult is being able to purchase as many plums as I want at once <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> a problem: I don't actually have anything to talk about right now. whoops <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> so I'm gonna stall for a bit and talk about nonsense <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I want to post a fic I just finished but I'm currently at 993 tweets and it would be really neat if the link was my 1000th tweet <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> it's kind of important too and it just cuts off in the middle <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> lmao it's a good thing I'm editing this cuz there's a part in the middle where I literally forgot to finish a sentence whoops <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> the nickname is cute btw the fic itself is ______ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I fucking. Forgot asgore's name was asgore for a moment. I just saw it written and was like "wasn't his name torgore" gdi <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm gonna try having chara call asriel "ree" in this thing I'm editing cuz it IS pretty cute <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ree is cute but I can't accept riel because it makes me think of louis riel and then suddenly I'm back in ninth grade social studies <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ it IS a good line I just feel guilty about tagging even cute + silly stuff with a reference to something so dark <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> (suicide mention) I mean, asriel/flowey only says it when talking about how he didn't want to live anymore. I gotta find a replacement <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ that is...a good point. chara do you need to tell us something <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> and act like the barking is words, but that kind of conflicts with what we know about them lol <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ YEAH exactly. I mean I guess chara could be one of those really weirdly positive people who like to talk to their pets <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I think? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> it's the same as the "what a meaningful conversation!" line, cuz it's clearly NOT a meaningful conversation, which means it has to be a joke <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @belowtale imo it was definitely sarcastic cuz I can't imagine a coffin ever genuinely being comfortable and chara strikes me as snarky <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ you should it's an A++ comic <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ and she doesn't and it's good and I remember being really happy with it. there might have been other terrible content <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ god they might have. ugh. I just remember the manga having a sidestory where he worries haruhi looks down on him for it <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'll stop though cuz I don't fucking remember lol I might be totally wrong <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> like there ARE jokes but not about those specific aspects of his identity, from what I can remember? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> haruhi has a bisexual gnc dad who isn't just a joke which I will always appreciate <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @feralphoenix GOOD, that's what it's supposed to be, it's just never what I originally intend to do lol <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> the way I characterize chara in my head never actually aligns with the way I write them. wtf. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I love chara but they always turn out unnecessarily aggressive in my fics, then I read through them and I'm like "is this even still cute" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> in other news, I'm trying to write a cute fic and chara is turning into such an asshole. why does chara always do this to me <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @feralphoenix ASDFHKHNFANKDHNKNK <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> that category being "shit that kills me every time because I can't even handle how good it is" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> masquerades are another thing that feel like they belong in the same category as arranged marriages and bridal carries for some reason <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @feralphoenix @buccelIati HOLY SHIT....masks are so...listen, please, please think about it , please consider masquerades <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @buccelIati feral help <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @buccelIati F UCK I really want to but I've never been one of those people who collects clothing refs and I don't even know where to begin <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @buccelIati listen, you need to especially do the hot ballroom clothes one, that one is vital to the au <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I could do that though. oh my god I have that power. this is too much <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> that isn't just "they have a wedding and dance and asriel carries chara" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> look. look. I will consider writing charasriel arranged marriage au when I can actually come up with some semblance of a plot <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @buccelIati DRAW THE DANCING!!! DRAW THE DIP!!!!!! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @feralphoenix I c an't (I might someday) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I want to write a super long, sappy charasriel fic with all these romance tropes so badly but it's too embarrassing omg <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> asriel would be so pleased with himself and chara would just be all embarrassed and "CAN yuO FUCKING NOT"-ing <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ASRIEL WOULD BE SO MUCH BIGGER THAN CHARA TOO.....it would be so easy for him to lift and dip them once he grew up *hyperventilating* <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @buccelIati I'm dying right now <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @S_MaYu_no: https://t.co/ubRTiVfHpg <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> it doesn't even have to happen in an arranged marriage au it can happen in literally any fic but they feel related somehow <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> even more unrelated to the arrangae marriage au than the ballroom dancing part: I am so fucking about bridal carries and hand-kissing <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> do you have any idea how into people dipping their partners I am. you don't. you can't possibly know <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @buccelIati YES!!!!!!!! YOU'RE HIRED <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> requirements: 
-meeting each other's eyes during a slow waltz and blushing
-fancy-ass clothes 
-TWIRLING <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> imo every arranged marriage au should have at least one romantic dance scene where they realize "wow this might not suck after all" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @feralphoenix I KNOW I SAW YOU TALKING ABOUT IT AND I'M EXCITED <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @buccelIati YEAH that's a good compromise. political marriages probably aren't super fun for the parties involved lol but then things Change <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I know it's not specifically an arranged marriage au trope, but, dancing. specifically ballroom dancing. some good shit right there <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @feralphoenix that's fair tbh most romance novels are garbage but I'm a sucker for a lot of the tropes because I've been brainwashed <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ALSO GOD CHARA AS AN OFFICIAL ROYAL...with a crown and a throne and everything...I'm weak <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @lumalees I have like nothing new to contribute to this au it's just such a good thing to think about <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> AND FUCKING?? WEDDINGS???? WEDDINGS ARE SO ROMANTIC GOD I LOVE WEDDINGS IN FICS <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> you could have all those romance novel cliches, about how they don't get along at first, but slowly start to like each other <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @buccelIati even if you don't end up writing the fic please at least draw them in fancy royal clothes sometime stuff like that kills me <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @feralphoenix f uck. fuck. it's just? like mars was saying, a political thing, an alliance between humans and monsters. it would be so g ood <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> when I was like nine years old I wrote so much terrible fanfic about bowser being a dad for the koopalings it was so Bad <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @RINMAKlS you come into my house, you talk shit about the koopalings. my children and I will not stand for this <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @RINMAKlS FUCK OFF!!!!!!!!!! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @RINMAKlS SSSSHUT UP PAPER JAM'S GONNA BE GOOD CUZ THE FREAKING KOOPALINGS ARE IN IT OK!!!!! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Charatoria that's fair tbh cuz now that I think about it my definition of good is literally just "I got to play as luigi" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> also the bedsmith was cute, and dream's deep was neat. but more importantly. infinite luigis <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> dream team was good bc you got to have like a million luigis. any game would be good if you could have as many luigis as you wanted <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Charatoria sticker star was bad but the mario &amp; luigi games have always been pretty good.......have faith................ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> if the final boss of paper jam isn't a corrupted paper luigi then I'm suing nintendo bc otherwise why the fuck isn't he in the game <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> for the record, my favourite koopaling is lemmy bc all he wants to do is join the circus and I find that #relatable <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> this fanfic is soon to be an award-winning trilogy once frisk enters the mix <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> chara: it's just a game, don't take it so seriously. but yeah the god of hyperdeath should ask the human out 
asriel: I need to go right now <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> asriel: they, they can't do that 
chara: why not? they're just imaginary. I think we should make them date 
asriel: 
chara: =) =) =) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> asriel: now the god of hyperdeath and the ultimate human are partners in fighting evil
chara: I think they should kiss 
asriel: 
chara: =) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> sneak preview of the continued adventures of the god of hyperdeath: <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> They have Pokemon toys at McDonald's now and I was so ready to buy them all but they only have groudon what the fuck <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ hell yeah if I write a part two it's a full collaboration and asriel is so Scared <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I just walked into a stop sign <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ I refuse to build a legacy of ironically terrible fanfic <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ not even remotely in progress as it stands but I REALLY WANNA DO MORE ALREADY <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ Chara's goal is to work in as many cool magic knives and gay shit as possible and asriel can't tell if it's intentional <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ chara makes asriel let them help write the continued adventures of the god of hyperdeath <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ I haven't read it cuz I tend to avoid no mercy fics and it looks sort of confusing anyway, sorry <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @RINMAKlS I WAS THINKING OF THE KNIFE STREAM AND HOW WE KEPT TALKING ABOUT WANTING KNIVES <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ THANK U this is gonna be the starred review on the cover of the paperback edition <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ I had to make it as gay as possible I literally do not know any other way to write <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ i'M SO GLAD THANK YOU <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @mininephthys t...thank you...(crawls back under Embarrassment Desk) <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> this is the dumbest thing I've ever done https://t.co/1V0JJhqCjd <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ I need to try and make it not awful first <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I don't even know if I want to publish it I literally can't tell if it's good or terrible <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I've spent the past half hour or so frantically writing the stupidest fanfic I have ever written <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The entire ost is just endless remixes of simple melodies and I will never stop being shocked when people find more <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ but I mean snowdin might be undertale the song. The entire ost is undertale the song probably <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ dating music is  the snowdin theme I think I'd have to listen again to find out <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> WHAT A GOOD FUCKINg CHOICE FOR A FINAL SONG <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> JESUS CHR IS T <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> What am I even listening to <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ THIS IS ME AND CHARA'S SONG, THIS IS OUR BATTLE SONG, WHEN WE DESTROY OUR ENEMIES <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Fall Out Boy x Skrillex x Zomboy x Gravity Falls holy shit <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> "I don't know why. Don't ask me. I have no idea where we are or where these knives are coming from <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Knife sounds also make me feel like, a long thing metal rod being pushed through my ear, if that makes any sense. Ugh <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @nekcihcyerewolf SAME??? What is even up with that <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Jesus Christ the sound of sharpening knives = sensory hell <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> BABY KNIVES <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I genuinely made myself sad just now by typing that out that's how you know I'm tired <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> *asriel voice* if I could swing a really big sword it wouldn't even matter if anyone loved me or not <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> asriel is probably really into swords tbh he and chara bonded over pointy bladed things <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> do knife people only use their tacky christmas knives in december, like, do they have to put them away for the rest of the year <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> WHY IS IT CALLED "QUACK QUACK" <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @feralphoenix we're watching cutlery corner it's magical <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I make up for it by buying as many toy swords as I can <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I remember this one time my family went into the city and we found a store that sold swords and I really wanted one but my mom said no :c <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> What the literal fuck is this it looks like some kind of fantasy weap as I was typing this he said it looked like a zombie slayer oh my god <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I am so concerned about the people working on this <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> they keep asking where these knives are even coming from, how do they not know??? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> jesus christ this looks like some kind of future knife <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @belowtale asriel bc he uses swords in the boss fight against him he would totally be into cutlery corner <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> I'm fucking ordering the lapis lazuli knife you can't fucking stop me <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> he doesn't remember it, it just appeared in the studio one day in the middle of a stream. cutlery corner creepypasta <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> I don't understand the pricing on this show??? everything is like 64 dollars and 12 cents or 39 dollars and 1 cent and I hate it <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> that red and blue handle is the ugliest fucking thing I've ever seen <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm watching the knife thing bc I missed it last time <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I genuinely feel so betrayed right now. I might need a moment <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @feralphoenix @simplycarryon I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @simplycarryon THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT HE MEANT I was losing my shit over it and now my life has lost a little of its magic <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I thought he was talking about his personal timeline in a time travel sense and I was like "what a weird fucking thing to say" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I saw this and thought it was the funniest thing in the world bc I didn't know Twitter stuff is called a timeline https://t.co/1HX7SXKvTK <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @belowtale I'm pretty sure every arc is a completely different timeline even though some of them share elements <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I downloaded neko atsume...where are the cats. I am waiting <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Body/eye horror in lrt (the adorable kind though) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @belowtale: eye horror t ]] 
i wanted to put these two sketch sets of void chara together .. a small egg https://t.co/uQJta9nA5m <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> my asriel and chara headcanons change constantly tbh <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> pre-canon asriel is a melodramatic brat I will fight you on this <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @RINMAKlS: asriel: like, y'know, nyah

chara: what

asriel: :3c nyah

chara: Stop <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> all I ever post on Twitter is links to stuff on Tumblr, whoops <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ honestly?? It should be, especially with the "nyah" at the bottom <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> every undertale artist in the world needs to start drawing asriel with flowey's expressions I demand it <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I FINALLY FOUND IT https://t.co/Bz27YVUY8J <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Nobody draws human asriel though and that makes me sad <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I like how I haven't seen a single skinny white undertale humanization so far <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I say "found" as though I put forth any effort whatsoever into discovering it <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I just found a sans version of kagerou daze I can't believe this <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ toriel telling me I was very good legitimately made me want to cry a tiny bit <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> *undyne pops out of nowhere wearing asgore's cloak* look, I'm asgore! Howdy, howdy, howdy <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I should develop it into a full-length thing about the two of them falling in love <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I wrote about a farm girl who found an alien in a cornfield and it was Bad <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> we had fifteen minutes to write a short story that included the words tractor, scamper, and outrageously <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> just went to the flash fiction friday  event hosted by the creative writing club *hyperventilates into a paper bag* <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> basically I want all the shipfics I read to feel like harlequin romances set in the regency era <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> guilty pleasure romance tropes: 
1. arranged marriages 
2. hand kissing 
3. bridal carrying 
4. ballroom dancing <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> "They often have chibi or kawaii mascot characters..." I cannot believe that is something I was made to hear with my own two ears <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> we watched an episode of ghost in the shell for sci fi class and this mra type is talking about his "experiences with Japanese animation" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @chemiosmotic_: @lumalees flowey says "shit" for the first time and then resets the timeline out of embarassment <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ I bet it would take him a while to build up to it tho. Shifty eyes, make sure no one's watching. A whispered "h...heck" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> flowey is grounded. Go wash your mouth out with soap young man <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I don't remember him ever saying that. where the fuck did he pick up such foul language <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I had to check wikiquote for the exact wording of that and I saw a flowey quote where he tells you that you're "pissing him off" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> papyrus: YOU KNOW WHAT'S "SUP", ONII-CHAN! IT'S BEEN EIGHT DAYS AND YOU STILL HAVEN'T...RECALIBRATED. YOUR. PUZZLES! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ANIKI <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @FwugRadiation: @cubewatermelon papyrus would definitely use "aniki." i think. what's your take. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Like they're not even doing anything, there's no magical wieners going on, it's just naked skeletons <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> funniest thing in the world: ppl tagging undertale fanart of sans or paps in skimpy clothing as nsfw <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> napstablook https://t.co/isUgV45S8T <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> another good undertale voice headcanon that nobody seems to share: napstablook is strong sad <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> sans: I've never met asriel is he real or imaginary 
frisk: he's real and he does improvised hip hop <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> This is the only good sans voice headcanon https://t.co/wndYhfhTF1 <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @feralphoenix if they did I missed it what the FRICK. could I have already fulfilled my dream???? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @feralphoenix WHAT <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> my dream is to have somebody make unsolicited fanart of something I've written someday. Will it ever happen? Probably not <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @RINMAKlS u have good taste I applaud you <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> "Fall means pumpkin spice!" WHATEVER!!!!! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @RINMAKlS GOD ME NEITHER and everyone is always so pumped about it and I'm just like ??? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Apple pie is ambrosia though <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Defensive? Protective? W/e the point is pumpkin pie IS NOT THAT GREAT <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @RINMAKlS pumpkin pie is gross tbh but everyone always gets so defensive of it <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @buccelIati f Uck. God dammit <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Is it even called shitposting on Twitter? Shit tweeting. Shiteeting <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> happy thanksgiving americans who wants to see me shitpost about professor layton <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @buccelIati it's too late you read the tweet the image is in your brain and the deed is done <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I used to ship Layton with descole when I was a dumb teenager then Azran legacy happened and I can never wash away the sin <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I guess I have to pretend I was going to floor 9 all along then secretly walk back down to 3 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I got on the elevator and was so distracted by being funny on Twitter that I forgot to punch the button for my floor <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Comedy gold right there, I'm hilarious <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm no good at making images but imagine a picture of descole and professor sycamore with the caption "I can be your devil or angel" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @buccelIati ok maybe if you ignore his hair he's a tiny bit hot but only because he's got red eyes <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> nobody with hair that looks like it should be served for breakfast with jam can be considered "hot" ok I'm sorry but them's the facts <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @buccelIati he's not have you not seen his fucking hair <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> WHEN MY BROTHER MOVES INTO HIS NEW APARTMENT WITH HIS BEST FRIEND THEY'RE GONNA MAKE ME SPAGHETTI YESSSSSS <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> omfg I was wondering why people were being so weirdly gracious today but it's thanksgiving in the states <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> My hair is getting long again I need to get a really gay haircut soon <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @steelforgedbond: and now for my next song: Asriel Didn't Deserve This Shit Why Couldn't We At least Save Him What The Fuck https://t.co‚Ä¶ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I think I may have reblogged one or two comics from there that I found in the asriel tag but then I checked out the actual blog and ugh <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> dreemurr reborn is bad bc 
a) fucking awful treatment of chara
b) repeated misgendering of frisk, from what I've seen <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm miserable but not so miserable I can't keep checking twitter <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm crying for like the third time today Jesus Christ what is wrong with me <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @buccelIati your chara has the fluffiest hair for the record <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> gonna get off twitter for a bit <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> and now I'm just sitting her rambling justifications for me being awful into the void instead of doing homework <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> today is such a gross day. I woke up feeling awful, cried in class, and now I just feel like XXXXXX <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm sure there's a very obvious explanation but as it is they just come out of the woodwork and it unsettles me. how are you finding me <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm still new to twitter so sometimes people start interacting with me when I have no idea who the fuck they are or where they came from <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> new topic: who the fuck is thao calderone and why did they rt my comment about wanting to see healthy relationships <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I am 100% done talking about this now I swear <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> but for now it's just important for me to see young ppl relating in healthy, positive ways to each other cuz I didn't get much of that <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> unsafe" then I'll definitely back off" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> the priority always has to be the comfort/safety of others though so if anyone ever directly approaches me and says "you are making me feel <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> it's a complex subject I guess? and I don't think there's any way to definitively say if it's ok or if it's morally objectionable <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ugh I feel gross. I don't know if I explained any of that well. I'm probably being nasty. I'm sorry, I'm not that good with words today <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I don't think that's predatory in an of itself, but it can easily become that if you make it more about the intimacy than the relationships <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I just. it means a lot to be able to enjoy narratives where kids can recognize feelings in themselves that I wasn't able to recognize <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I have no idea if I'm making any sense. basically, I don't think 'shipping' children is necessarily bad, but it can VERY EASILY become bad <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> when ppl go further than that it becomes exploitative instead of sympathetic <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> like?? "I see myself in this character, I like them having a crush cuz it reminds me of me" that's cool. you can stop right there <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> just don't make it about the physical stuff so much jfc. so much of it turns into fanart of them passionately making out or something <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> bc that HAPPENS, kids get crushes on each other, that's life, sometimes people project their experiences onto the characters <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I feel like it's more ok in situations where, I dunno, people want to write about young lesbians coming to terms with their identity <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> bc so often people make it about sex, and like, that's inherently disgusting <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I completely understand why ppl get uncomfortable with shipping characters under 18 and try to respect that 100% <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @belowtale GOD YEAH I keep seeing this gross ass stuff with toriel. I hate it all so much <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm being so incoherent right now, sorry, I'm just upset over how creepy and predatory literally every fandom can be at times <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> there are so many comics and shit floating around of an older frisk making sex jokes and it's just. fuck, can you not <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> affectionate stuff like holding hands and cheek smooching is fine but so many people cross the line and make it gross <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> why can't it just be "I really like how much these two characters care about each other"? why does it have to be "they gotta fuck" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> just, why does everything have to be sexual?? why does everything have to be physical??? why can't people just care about each other <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I feel like I have stuff I wanna say but it's all coming out wrong so like whatever <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm not even remotely the right person to talk about any of this tbh <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I gotta stop cuz everything I'm saying has been said before lol it's just something that pisses me off <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> you're looking at a goofy adoptive uncle-type and a literal child, and thinking "that should be romantic". just stop, you're nasty <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> making them older doesn't change that imbalance between them? besides u clearly just want to feel justified shipping a child with an adult <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> like even when frisk is in their thirties sans will still have been the guy who, I dunno, tucked them in at night <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @feralphoenix it just seems to obvious to me?? if someone was like a father/uncle/whatever to you, they're always going to have been that <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @feralphoenix u have good opinions, ppl never seem to consider how the relationship remains unequal even when they're aged-up <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> today is literally the worst <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> talking about posthumanism in sci fi class. Man do I wish I could stop being human <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> just had a minor freak out in class for literally no reason, cool. I love crying in public <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> more fanart of chara being nice to flowey pls <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> That sweater tweet is already my most popular one I'm moving up in the world faster than you'd think <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> chara: let's sew all our sweaters together and make a parachute and jump off a cliff to see if we can fly
asriel: that's a fantastic idea <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Chara and asriel are the opposite of that, normally chara is reserved and asriel is a super good son but put them together and you get Hell <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> You know that post that's like "I'm gonna cut off the sleeves on my shirts while my wife is away cuz she's like 85% of my impulse control"? <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> I keep starting charasriel fics that I can't finish because of all the terms papers I have to write, I can't wait until the holidays <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @chemiosmotic_ hell yeah, is there a term for that tho? A fleshie? Asriel is absolutely a fleshie <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> I can't stop thinking about sansabeth making terrible puns <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @belowtale ur right and I am ashamed. who would paps be though <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @feralphoenix *chanting* do it do it do it bring the pain <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I say "I've thought about this" but what I actually mean is that the pun "megidovania" occurred to me one night and I couldn't let it go <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @belowtale theo can be papyrus maybe <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @belowtale I've thought about this before actually?? and my conclusion is, that elizabeth is sans, and her theme song is megidovania <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> "I see two lovers staring over the edge of the cauldron of hell" ur like ten please chill <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> like it's fucking awful and horrifying, but also, calm the fuck down chara <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I know it's actually not even remotely funny but chara's comments about rg01 and rg02 in the no mercy route always make me laugh <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> YOU'RE WELCOME. thank you and goodnight <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> this comic, only with flowey teaching frisk swears and sans or somebody interrupting https://t.co/Y9RPQlHQOe <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm going to bed now, but first, an idea <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> it gets to the point where I can barely handle playing the game again or watching an lp, it's so weird <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> like I love hearing people talk about undertale but following toby's twitter and seeing him mention it is almost Too Much <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> do you ever get overwhelmed by your own special interest?? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> lemme make up for it with a status update. current status: thinking about cuttin off all my hair <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm so bad at twitter whoops <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @belowtale: @RINMAKlS https://t.co/cIlHYr7WpK <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @RINMAKlS @RINMAKlS YESSS that is my ideal 'chara lives' au, they just kind of adopt everyone as hard as they can. toriel is so proud <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @RINMAKlS they basically grow up to be a super hardcore and hotblooded toriel <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @RINMAKlS and they just really, really feel for little kids in bad situations cuz they can relate SO HARD <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @RINMAKlS but STILL I hc chara as being like super lanky so they decide they gotta protect frisk and asriel bc they're smol <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @RINMAKlS big sin also works tbh <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @RINMAKlS favourite "everyone lives" au to think about is, chara being the cool but slightly overprotective older sibling <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @RINMAKlS like it takes forever for them to actually love someone because they have to protect themselves y'know but god DAMN <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @RINMAKlS chara would do literally anything for the ppl who have managed to win their trust that is Fact in my mind <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> chara: =) (me screaming with my mouth closed) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> "AAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH" "chara u ok there buddy" "yeah I just gottaAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH ok I'm good" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> in an au where everyone someone survives they probably get a tantrum room where they can go and just. shriek and punch things for a bit <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> bc all day I have been wanting to bury my face in a pillow and scream in frustration and that strikes me as a chara kinda thing to do <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I haven't been on twitter all day but I just wanna say that chara is probably the kind of person who just needs to Scream sometimes <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> the point is, those were some cute charas <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @RINMAKlS LOL that's what I was thinking, ppl theorize sans was "bleeding" ketchup anyway so why not <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @RINMAKlS I think most ppl either just don't think about it OR they realize it'll take a while for anyone to register dusty clothes as Bad <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @RINMAKlS ppl instinctively associate blood with violence/horror I guess? Moreso than dust even though that's more likely to be the case <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ myself, why do u find chara's blood-splattered little smiling face so cute <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @RINMAKlS IT SERIOUSLY IS GOD <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> *shaylyn thinks of asriel dreemurr and pounds the ground with her fists* <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @feralphoenix ok I'm actually kind of relieved then <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It is the weeniest voice I've ever heard in my entire life and I need to know if asriel talks like that <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Important question: does flowey have the same voice as asriel bc in the no mercy route you actually get to hear flowey's canon voice <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> SO MUCH GOOD ASRIEL/FLOWEY META THANK U <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm listening to this mettaton/electro swing mix while eating lasagna and life is Good <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @simplycarryon rip in peace <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It's definitely not Good though like these children definitely need an adult taking care of them <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> "Everyone hurt us so we don't need anybody else, let's go get revenge" ie a slightly altered no mercy route <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I love happy/healthy charasriel but also I secretly love the really fucked up kind where they decide the whole world can go to hell <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> also, asriel and chara are basically asgore and toriel 2.0. they're so cute together that nobody really minds chara being unofficial monarch <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Asriel can be a bit of a softy like his dad and want to avoid conflict but chara makes him deal with it and it's ultimately for the best <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It's actually a good thing cuz they're a remarkably good strategist and can push asriel to make the hard decisions he might not want to make <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> But they're still the unofficial co-ruler bc everyone in the underground knows that they and asriel are inseparable <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> All that talk of being the future of humans and monsters terrifies them and they don't want to have to deal with that kind of pressure <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Headcanon for the "chara and asriel both survive" au: asriel obviously becomes king when he grows up but chara rejects any sort of title <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @xenosexy: homestuck shipping is still the best thing to come from it <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> If I ever accidentally write something """popular""" remind me to delete I never want that to happen again <Text_End>
