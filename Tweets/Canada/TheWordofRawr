<Text_Begin> Now for a game that could have legitimately been on my GotY list #PS4share https://t.co/Ot8EbI52cn <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Cleric Beast down.
Used all my vials though... Because I suck and haven't played in months. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Touch Arcade giving their Mobile GOTY to Landsliders sort of sums up all the issues with mobile gamers quite nicely
(The game is crap) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NintendoTweet ...nothing else was pretentious enough.
As far a Axiom Verge goes... It's a better Metroid game than Nintendo's ever made. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NintendoTweet Tearaway and XCX are the only 2 "AAA" games on my top 10. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NintendoTweet 
5. Tearaway Unfolded
4. OlliOlli2
3. Everybody's Gone to the Rapture
2. Hotline Miami 2
1. Axiom Verge <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> :| I almost killed the wolf at the beginning barehanded.
Then Bloodborne would have been my GOTY
(Just kidding... It's still not top 10) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Speaking of Bloodborne #PS4share https://t.co/jW1MkXIFBO <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NintendoTweet No clue...

BUT BLOODBORNE SHOULD HAVE BEEN GOTY <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Guys.
I know it's Christmas...

BUT HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT BLOODBORNE? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GuerrillaDawg what level are you? I'm level 18... And stuck at the beginning of chapter 5. Can't figure out what to do... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mp1990GAF why do I hate the 3DS? It feels cheap, and its super uncomfortable to use. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mp1990GAF I already own it... But I hate the 3DS, so I'll never play it. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Which reminds me;
Unless you know a couple... like really... really know them...
Don't ask them when they're having kids (or why they don't) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The nice thing about this xmas/anniversary is that we finally don't have to deal with people asking when we're going to have a kid... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AltSeth for a second I read that as Sticky Fingers, and thought you were listening to Onyx <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis @RobotBrush PS4 version comes with the expansion too... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Feel like the narrative suffers a bit because of the single player MMO-ish feel of the game. I literally don't care at all about the story. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Xenoblade Chronicles X is a lot better than the original, but is still super grind-y... but the way you "grind" isn't really great. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NintendoTweet If they focused on a single system, they could realistically support it properly, and justify purchases for people. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NintendoTweet No. Solution is to cut down to 1 piece of HW. Nintendo has struggled, because of poor 3rd party relations... for 2+ decades <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> (Which outside of the current Steam sale, is actually more expensive on PC, than it is on PS4... in CAD) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ...That whole rant was triggered by ignorant posts on the PSBlog, complaining about the pricing on Infinifactory... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @CodeRedShell Kinda like asking a Neo-Nazi about Jews, or the KKK about Black culture. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Now they get to deal with the shit posts from people that never intended to buy the games anyway, but want to bitch that they aren't $3. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Sony/MS shot themselves in the foot the second they started offering Steam like price reductions, and free games w/PS+ and XBL. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NintendoTweet I figured it out before... gen to gen from NES to now is about 20-25% retraction of install base, w/each new gen. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NintendoTweet Wii being the exception to that rule of course... but that was more dumb luck than calculated strategy. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NintendoTweet lol It's the truth though. Sale numbers (for home consoles) has tracked downwards each gen since they got real comp... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Woke up at 3:30am to feed the baby, and felt kinda gross. Made the mistake of ready community comments... now I feel worse. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NintendoTweet ...Nintendo doesn't try to compete with anyone, because they think they're too good... which is why they are where they are. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NintendoTweet Sony/MS are trying to compete with the cesspool that is Steam. And Steam is trying to compete with the App Store... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The "I'll wait 'til it's $3 on Steam" people are everything that's wrong with this community. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mp1990GAF Smash is completely unplayable. MK8 is fine though. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis don't think for a second that Oculus "exclusives" are anything more than timed. They need to profit of these games <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I built my first PC before most of the shitty PC community existed. I'm entitled to my trolling of they trashy dumbfuckery <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Sorry... Steam is also clogged up with a bunch of mediocre niche games, and iOS ports now too. 
But its all in 4K so its GREAT <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Every game should be on PC. 
So Master Racers have more subpar console ports to play... With their piles of Early Access stuff. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GuerrillaDawg probably not. 
Has Sony sent you your check yet? I just got mine... (HAVE U HEARD ABOUT UNTIL DAWN) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mp1990GAF what are you playing it on? I had it on Wii U. Honestly thought the track design was better than MK8 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis because he dick rides PC gamers... Talks about import stuff like FoV sliders and options menus <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AltSeth apparently it had some licensing... I've just been reading that the new stuff is kinda bad. I'll wait for Thumper later in the yr <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch I don't care for his shtick. Even when I was a PC gamer... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch TB is also a fucking scumbag... So why would people care what he says? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I think the game is great. I just think it looks like a PS2 game half the time. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Pretty sure at least one person unfollowed me because I said XCX looked like crap on my TV. As a social experiment, I'll repeat that... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @CartridgeGames @GuerrillaDawg @ItsameDennis https://t.co/9HY95naxMJ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GuerrillaDawg @ItsameDennis I have Hearthstone... and a bunch of other mobile games like INSERT SQUEENIX IP Go. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GuerrillaDawg @ItsameDennis lol Ubi has literally released the same mediocre infinite runner 3 times... People clearly still give them $$ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GuerrillaDawg @ItsameDennis Twitter has a search function... I'm lazy, not retarded :} <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GuerrillaDawg @ItsameDennis BTW... HAVE U HEARD ABOUT THE GREAT NEW F2P RAYMAN GAME AVAILABLE FOR MOST MOBILE DEVICES. IT'S 5 STAR <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GuerrillaDawg @ItsameDennis Apparently good... if I haven't heard about someone that shills for Ubi <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AltSeth Disappointing though. Issue is apparently a lack of licensed tracks, not the game itself. Music apparently just isn't great. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis wtf is Crossing Eden <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> hmmm early Amplitude reviews aren't great. Might just pass on it then... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Yeah... but that's not news...
BTW... U EXCITED FOR THOSE NEW ASSASSINS CREED GAMEZ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis why u sad... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis I have my copy pre-paid... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis I've been saying that for a while... Colin is completely intolerable, and Greg just doesn't know wtf he's talking about <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The only downside of working from home is dealing with a baby that's hangry AF. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 But only on SMB levels... Not on 3, W or Abomination... It's kinda dumb. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 They give you snazzy Yoshi colours in Woolly World... The Mario Maker stuff is dumb. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 /says the guy that buys all the amiibo <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 Pull people in... get them to spend more money. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis I just saved the gif to my laptop... I don't have the link <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> https://t.co/ciptKLJE2L <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> DSIII already has one thing over Bloodborne...
It's not a PS4 exclusive, so all the PCMASTERBATERS and XBOTS don't have to get butthurt <Text_End>

HAZ U HERD BOUT DARK SOULS III <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheFrugster Don't worry... the Dark Souls 3 circle jerk is coming. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Except that you're an Xbot. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis BTW, my initial point was that I don't see Sony "letting" Insomniac delay RaC, since they aren't internal. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis So it's exactly like Sony 1st party then... :} <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis technically second party... An independent studio developing a game to be published and owned by Sony. Like Hot Shot's Golf. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis It's not a 1st party title... so no reason to delay it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> #FUCKAAAVIDYAGAEMZ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> (The Witness &amp; Firewatch) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The games I legit care the most about will be out by Feb... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Let's all be honest... Does Sony have any reason what so ever to rush 1st party games out the door, when they've slaughtering their comp. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> TBH... I'm not THAT excited to play UC4 either <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Souls franchise (more accurately FROM) is treading into AC/CoD territory, but lack any form of compelling narrative to make me come back <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Just when I thought I couldn't be any less excited for Dark Souls 3... ND delays UC4 into the same month. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis So one game worth buying :} <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 So it'll still be underpowered... coming out 3yrs after the current gen systems. GG Nintendo. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 Rumour from a fansite yesterday that NX will be shown behind closed doors at CES. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> At the end of the day, I understand why Nintendo focuses so heavily on their popular (and relevant) IP in Smash, but I don't have to like it <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm still salty about that. Not because I liked, or played Ice Climbers, but because Super Smash's roster is too focused on select IP. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Ono's reasoning for not including Sagat is only slightly better than the reason Sakurai used for pulling Ice Climbers. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I've officially been married for 10yrs. 
why the fuck has anyone put up with me this long lol <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm guessing FFX is pretty linear...? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @omek90 https://t.co/bhyNiVZQt8 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @omek90 He's "tryhard" in the sense that Marvel tries to hard to make him come off as edgy. I'm not a fan of his era of comics either. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @omek90 he a bit of a "tryhard" though. Marvel keeps him around because he fits into this 90's XTREME niche of comics that people like, <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Deadpool is an awful relic of 90's "edgy" X comics from Marvel.
One day I'll understand why he's popular.
That day is clearly not today. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Inifinifactory is a pretty outstanding puzzle game. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Also... Overwatch looks super boring. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It's my biggest dread, and why I'll most certainly pass on Overwatch. Studio is incapable of balancing their games. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> If Ubisoft doesn't have a QA department... Blizz sure as hell doesn't have anyone that works on game balance. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Face Hunters are basically cancer.
Secret Pallies are herpes.
Hearthstone is a mistake, it's nothing but trash. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Renton127 I'd rather Mario Maker than Witcher 3 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Gonna go back to watching Chefs Table. Fuck the MCU <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Why am I an hour and 40 mins into this PoS, and nothing has happened... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @johnnydork @GuerrillaDawg I'm thinking about drinking til I forget this garbage... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Thank fucking god I'm watching this trash on Netflix. It's an expansion on everything that was wrong with the first movie. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Age of Ultron is a pretty bad movie so far... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 Until Dawn. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 Japan was a mistake. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Blitzball is sorta dumb <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AltSeth What I played of the narrative was pretty generic fantasy lit. I don't like stuff like that (or Game of Thrones). Bit cheesy. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AltSeth I only made it through about 5-6hrs. Game was a technical mess at launch, and I really didn't like the combat or crafting mechanics <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Honestly, the Witcher 3/CDPR dickriding is worse than the "Bloodborne was robbed" people.
Neither game is in my top 10 this year anyway... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Witcher 3's writing isn't bad. It's also not something I'd call good either... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheFrugster I know. It's clearly the worst game ever developed. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Gonna stop reading peoples GOTY lists, because every time I read people gush about Witcher 3's writing, I die a little inside. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> For what it's worth... Dawg's GOTY list is pretty good, outside of Witcher 3 and GoT. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 tomorrow, I believe. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @wlatham92 I don't feel too bad, because I got it at a pretty decent discount with the SE... shame the whole game wasn't great... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Earned 1 PSN trophy (1 bronze) in FINAL FANTASY X HD - https://t.co/p4uUPiZ39W <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm intentionally reading more Force Awakens spoilers. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis GAF goin full retard for the holidays. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It's Xmas week, so I'm gonna go home now and work from home for the rest of the week <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @omek90 I have PS+, so my PS4 updates dl and install when the system is in standby <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis brah... that's top tier XBONE graphix right there. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mp1990GAF fite me. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mp1990GAF I thought you said Woolly World was your GOTY? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 same. Although I really shouldn't buy anymore shit. I own almost all the games anyway lol <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 She's a girl, and girls aren't allow to know anything apparently... or something like that <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @wlatham92 It's a value add for XBL as well, because of GwG. It's still 100% MS finding new, low cost means of generating revenue. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @wlatham92 ...you need to stick to the fanboy narrative though... that MS is magically the nice guy now, because of Phil. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheFrugster I'm tired of games w/gameplay. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GuerrillaDawg Best Wii U exclusive next year... (also about the only one) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I should try and beat Bloodborne one of these years... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> /endrant. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Plus... BC is still a shitty value add, because it means that the console isn't releasing with enough quality software to self-sustain. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It's not about corporate sympathy, or "defense forcing", it's about not being a idiot about things. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The whole PS2 classics argument is entitlement.
The "Sony shud do dis 4 free like M$" argument is stupid. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Sony has no means of monetizing PS2toPS4emu without charging for the games because of age.
Not that difficult to understand really. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> People still don't "get" that XB1 has BC, only because it's a way for MS to make money. Both through software sales, and value add to XBL <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Need to not read comments on articles about PS2toPS4 emulation. Comments range from entitled, to retarded. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 I should have stopped buying games in mid-Nov... instead I've bought a crap ton because of sales :| I has no time. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 I've heard good things... I can't bring myself to buy old games though, when I have new ones to play. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ...mostly because I have 0 faith in Nintendo's ability to make a quality handheld again. Or at least one that doesn't feel like ass. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I shouldn't actually care about NX at all... but if it has OffTV play like Wii U, I'll consider it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> If Nintendo is smart, they will follow MS &amp; Sony's lead, and not wait until E3 to unveil the NX. Too much to cover at that show. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Axis1500 If they're smart, they'll do a mini-reveal-conference like Sony did with the PS4. Gives impact w/o the clutter of E3. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Axis1500 Is that confirmed? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 What don't you like about X? Just curious? Only underwhelming part for me so far Yuna, and the summoning system. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 I just started it. I'm enjoying it so far. I also think that 7 and 8 are 2 of the worst FF... so there's that. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GuerrillaDawg XCX, I assume? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> XC3D was just a disaster, and the worst possible way to play that game...
So it's my Game &amp; Wario Award winner, as Worst Game of the Year. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Outside of technical issues on console, and a lot of convoluted systems... Witcher 3's writing is just sort of eye-roll-ish. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Witcher 3 would have been the worst game I played this year, if Xenoblade Chronicles 3D didn't exist. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I've lacked any motivation to keep playing Fallout. I really like it, but it came out at a real awkward time for me. Same with BLOPSIII. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> My formal GOTY list (w/honorable mentions) https://t.co/VsPO308gqG <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Having a similar issue with Woolly World that I had with the Mario 3D games (World &amp; Land). Curve is too slow, which makes early lvls dull. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Hip Hop (my genre of choice) is either too busy grasping at the mainstream pop train, or filling up unintelligent trap club tracks. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NintendoTweet there's at least been a few standouts each year for me. This year... Not so much. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> If I was to do an album of the year, it would be a lot harder than GotY. Music has been pretty trash this year. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Every time someone says Drake is a good MC, I die a little inside. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @PranooYY it's a cool game. Worth $20 for sure. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Is it 4 yet... 
Not even in the office yet...
Want to go back home...
It's gonna be a long fucking day... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> And by "gamers", I actually mean dickhead Master Racers, who dickwag about 4k res and brag about how awesome Steam is. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> PC gamers are the most delusional of all the fanboy groups. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis he has a stuffed panda named Aaron that he punches the shit out of all the time too... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Instead of playing video games, I sat and watched a 5wk old baby talk shit to a stuffed dog, then punch it in the face. This is my life. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> My newborn says a lot of nonsense... I'd swear he was an Xbot or something... Maybe even a Nintendoyearold. I'm gonna have a talk with him. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis dood, imagine how great that game would look at 4k on a $5000 PC or at 720p on the XBOX ONE ALL IN ONE ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 wasn't really part of mine. I'm an awkward age for that though. Too young for initial release, too old for rereleases <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @Stealth___ I'm on the opposite side of things. I grew tired of the clutter that comes with physical games/media <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis so it's just a random fucking list... that's dumb. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Homefront 2 is above other games. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I generally don't do twitter shout out or FFs because I follow/am followed by so few people it ends up being a circle jerk. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis @omek90 @GuerrillaDawg so he's a AAA release then... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis my cats. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @GuerrillaDawg @BrickyTweets @kriken_8 @PooWithEyes @i_kfor @ThePhantomPine @Flunkie @Kyoufu2011 AKA DA BEST LIST. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> This War of Mine on for $5US on the Google Play Store? Sure... I'll re-buy <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I do feel like this year (gaming wise) started, better than it finished. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The only games I legit disliked this year were Witcher 3 and Xenoblade Chronicles 3D. Everything else, at worst, as kinda mediocre. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It's also our 10th anniversary on the 23rd. 
If we're lucky, we'll get to eat dinner together, at the same time... and watch Netflix. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> 2015 was a good year. 
I beat more than a game a week.
I was impressed more than disappointed with games.
Wife and I finally had a kid. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @johnnydork Do I need to like, subscribe, and visit your Patreon page? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> That's enough of that...
*Insert video game IP that you love* is terrible, and you're terrible for liking it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> 2nd legit tweet...
I left my wife alone to dress the baby today, and this happened; https://t.co/CP8oZQX92o <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis how do you know it's not you from the past... maybe, I went back in time, and I'm secretly your father. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> That tweet is one of the most legit, non-twitter persona things I've ever posted. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> #peoplewhomademy2015 https://t.co/jcP1b5sXta <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I would start up a tumblr for that kind of stuff... But tbh, I'm too fucking lazy. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Twitter is still my best place to let out negativity, so I don have to make RL people deal with that. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheFrugster I liked the "fake footage" comment... like someone at ND was sitting around just building a trailer to fuck w/people. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Cool... I see downgrade talk again. 
From people that don't understand anything about game development, and why downgrades happen. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @wlatham92 Is it hard to get... Or do you just "get" it...? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @bfletchtone Nope. I didn't own a PS2 until after PS3 released, and I barely played it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I also still need to "beat" the FFXV demo eventually. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'd like to go home and play some more FFX HD. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 I don't remember Honey Bee being more offensive than some of the shit releases on Vita though. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 *shrug* Honestly, there's a lot of stuff that comes from Japan to the west that should be changed, because it's kind of gross. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 wut? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis I did my first playthrough on easy. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @passthemstickss That's sorta fucked up. Maybe your GS is just lazy AF... It's also been ~3-4yrs since I regularly bought physical games. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 Builders 2. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis *follows TimDog, Crapgamer, and friends*
Sure am excited for the best line up of exclusive ever on Xbox in 2015. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @passthemstickss Does GS not reseal them? EBgames up here will reseal the display box copies... sticker and all. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis :|
Fuck. Gonna just sell my PS4 for an XBOX ALL IN ONE ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM then... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @passthemstickss Were you trying to flip it for a profit? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis ...I'm not even buying a Nintendo game in place of dreams... I'm going to get FFXV. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis fite me Xbot... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Mario Maker will be the last "creation" app/game that I buy.
It's well done, but I don't think I want to pay to make my own game anymore. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Just getting tired of the "DURRR I DONT NEED NO PEASANT CONSOLE NOW" threads because game a, b, or c is hitting PC. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I can live without the "PC Only" stuff, like MOBAs and MMOs. Most of those games/communities are filth anyway. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Master Racers always trying to say that you don't need a console, when to be fair, if you have a console, you don't need a PC anymore. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Outside of Undertale (which is apparently coming to console next year), I feel like I've missed nothing w/o a PC for most of the year. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AltSeth People in general tbh. Middle-aged-to-Baby-boomer aged upper-middle to upper class white people specifically. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AltSeth The Canadian Conservatives don't either. They also don't believe in crazy things like human rights, and the fear mongering is wrong <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Dennis will block me if he knew the game that I had to drop from my 2016 list to get stupid FFXV. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @CodeRedShell Does the Wii U eShop do the "upgrade" discounts? It's honestly worth the $2 here for save-states. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Srsly though, there's a lot of cool stuff coming next year. Bit of stuff for everyone, plus all the crap that people bitch about every year. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> 2016 is shaping up to be what 2015 should have been, which was what 2014 was supposed to be... so 2017 should be GOAT. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm not going to be able to buy any of those games... but it's cool that they're coming. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> That BAMCO localization post started predictable, but went sorta crazy by the end... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Super Mario RPG is apparently coming to VC (At least in EU). All 7 people in the EU w/Wii U's should buy it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Too tired. Need coffee. 3am wake up with a hangry isn't fun on a work day. Oh well. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> When ever I see people with gaming laptops or Macbooks, I feel bad for them... They likely think they got their money worth for that trash. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Why does Tidus (in FFX) do that odd Fred-Savage-in-the-Wonder-Years inner monologue...? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @PranooYY I'm planning on winning the lottery so I might have enough money to buy all the stuff I want... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AltSeth they're closet racists, that's all. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Why so serious Batman? https://t.co/I0kqv8fyWj <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 what Chapter are you on? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 game is pretty easy. It's the mission board that's nonsense <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch lolalienware <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> As much as people bang the fanboy drum, there are just as many people banging the bullshit entitlement drum. 
Community will destroy us all. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Sony could/should reimburse some of the cost from PS2 Classic to PS4emu, but if you think it should be free you're an entitled shit. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> If you REALLY think that XB1 has BC (same with Wii U) as a pro consumer move, you're actually retarded. It's about selling software. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It amuses me that people don't understand the business differences between PS2 to PS4 and the Xbox 360 BC. Both are designed to make money. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis honestly, I'm just not sure I want to spend $400 for it day one... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis I'll end up getting a NX for Zelda and the dream of new Metroid and FZero <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis next up... Rebuying the Xbox One All In One Entertainment System so I can have the best library of games of all time. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis might as well buy a NX instead of PSVR (I might depending on the VR launch lineup and what NX is) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis I lost my soul when I bought Mario Maker and an amiibo. I'm dead inside. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> That's 4 of my projected 12 games for the year (AAA). Going balls deep into console JRPGs again. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm going to give FFXV a chance next year. Kingdom Hearts III as well... Assuming it releases. Plus P5 and WeebSMTxFE. That's <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis limited funds and time next year. I just will wait for sales on some of them. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> There are 1st party games for PS4 that I'd like, but won't buy in 2016. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis they're not the hero's we need, but they're the ones we deserve <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis crapgamer is my hero <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Reminder that a single man made a better Metroid game than all of Nintendo has in the last 25yrs. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GuerrillaDawg @ETDragonPunch @NESbot_feed hey... Have you heard about the real GotY...
.
.
.
.
.
BLOODBORNE
For real.
Fuck Witcher 3 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis hard pass for me regardless. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis I'd like to not want to buy it... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Things should be free because people don't understand why they shouldn't be and corporations shouldn't make money. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Wonderswan <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm not a Pony, I just play games on the system with the best games and the least shit fanbase. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch for free? Sure... There's a ton of reasons. It's like Nintendo charging for VC on each platform. Need to justify dev cost. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch where's the counter of "I'm entitled to things because I feel like I am" thread? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Mafia 3, by a new, and unknown dev, shouldn't place above UC4 on anyone's list. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis no. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis GAF is da worst. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Earned 2 PS4 trophies (2 bronze) in The Crew - https://t.co/p4uUPiZ39W <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> TFW you beat a gimmick deck with an even more gimmicky deck in Hearthstone... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Playing a bit more FFX HD... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Patch on load times for Just Cause 3, doesn't really help the load times much...Just gonna give up, until they provide a real fix. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ...Since XCX taught me that I don't hate JRPGs, just JRPGs on the 3DS, I bought the FFX/X-2 collection for PS4. Cost $27. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> 370z was the only non-'Murica bullshit car you could use to start... and it isn't exactly a great car. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> My biggest issue with The Crew is the starting cars... it's all bullshit modern 'Murican muscle. I hate US Auto... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Once you get the feeling of the controls, The Crew is actually pretty decent... even if it does have some issues... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I have 7 games listed already. (5 PS4, 2 Wii U) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> My goal for next year is to buy no more than 1 AAA game a month (not including those I've already paid for) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> My 2016 gaming resolution is to buy fewer games. 
So, logically, I'll buy a whole shit ton to close out 2015. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm trying to think if there's any HD remaster on PS4 I don't own... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis https://t.co/rVAaxyeBsi <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis https://t.co/AW4GrVOlTv <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Instant realization that XCX looks REAL BAD graphically on a 60" inch TV. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis ...mutha fucker... I'm moving it back to my desk TV so I can play it... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> PS4 to the big screen was a bust, since wife and baby watch too much Netflix. Swapping the consoles again... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Give the game props for being the single most "no homo, really" game I've ever played. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Guess FFXV demo 2.0 is OK. Not really sold on absolutely anything about the game. Combat is pretty awful. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Wife is watching Once upon a time on Netflix and this shit just keeps getting worse... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Had McDonalds for the first time in 5 or 6 years today... It's still not good. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Wife got home quickly, so I didn't really get to play FFXV. I'll give it a go in an hour or so during nap time. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis @NESbot_feed Table Tennis 2. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Gonna try the FFXV demo again... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Nah... I'm luck if I get 1 game a month... Most of the time I already own the PS+ stuff, unless it's new. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis As you should... :| My list included PS+ games...and multipack games being split up... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Boyes RT's some pleeb that has ~220 PS4 games... I have over 260... Get on my level. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Shep likes Hohokum. Baby already has GOAT video game taste. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Could be worse... I could own a Xbox One... And be excited for M$ Moneyhatted exclusives... Like a dirty American. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis U gonna be one of those kook kids that post NPD numbers, and troll Xbots now? Brag about PS4's exclusive *cough* DLC *cough* <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Game world is huge. Don't tell me "gather X from continent 1". That's not helpful. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Maybe I'm missing something, but why doesn't XCX give you more of an indication of where to go with most of the side quests... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis @jimmyelgringito I blame Just Cause 3, and it's bullshit loading times... That, and I moved the PS4 to the big screen. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis @jimmyelgringito Hey... I'm not one of the Nintendoyearolds that got butthurt when Nintendo de-sexualized an eleventeenyearold <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis @jimmyelgringito He's ded Dennis, it's time to move on...The bitter, perv-y Nintendoyearolds got to him. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I hate gated content... It's why I didn't like Mordor. I don't have patience/time to look up progression pre-requisites <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> XCX did the thing I hate, which is gate content behind side content. Devs... Srsly, don't fucking do that shit. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Played a little PS4...now back to XCX. @jimmyelgringito would be proud, if he wasn't ded. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I looked online at some TFA spoilers, because I think the concept of spoilers is fucking stupid. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis because people are literal trash <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 man... Just because Jar Jar is a Sith Master, doesn't make him cool <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis I'm a traitor...Order 1886 is the best RPG this year anyway <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis sorry... PC trash isn't eligible for GotY noms <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis what's its comp? Witcher 3FPS? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Side note; Once upon a time is a real dumb show. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis ...be a cool kid like me and play The Crew FEATURING THE VO WORK OF THE ONE AND ONLY TROY BAKER <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis lol I know. I don't really like AK very much. Only Batman I almost didn't beat... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Play something good :| <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> "The Wii U version doesn't have dream features we thought it should... so minus 3pts"
This is why Nintendo fans can't have nice things. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Nintendo sites are taking marks off the Minecraft port because it doesn't live up to a version of the game they made up in their head. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Honestly, with the slightly improved  handling from patching... Game isn't half bad... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I didn't have enough games with Troy Baker, so I bought The Crew <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm legitimately enjoying XCX more than Fallout 4... and I'm not sure how I feel about that. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GuerrillaDawg Buying a Wii U... playing 3DS... thinking about buying 3DS games... what's happened to you Dawg. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 Likely because people wanted an actually AC game to play, not some BS Mario Party clone. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AltSeth lol only 12hrs :) and that's with a bunch of idle time dealing with an angry baby. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Chapter 4 in XCX done. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch Any preference of system, or "generation"? A lot of the best JRPGs are classic, and you'll likely have to ROM them... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis @CartridgeGames I always am. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> People in the comments section calling out LOLTaku for complaining about Timed DLC... when it's Sony focused (even though MS did it for yrs) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Real talk; GENEI IBUN ROKU #FE looks better than FFXV <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis I just don't get excited about games if they make a bad first impression. Unfinished or not. That's just me though. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis That seems more like cautious optimism vs excitement... but whatever... I'm just being a dick about it now... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AltSeth I really disliked it. Combat system didn't click with me at all... and I don't like modern Squeenix character design. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis I don't think great presentation could carry something like FF... not if everything else isn't at least "good" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis sure... but those are more interactive art installation, than tradition game. FFXV is a traditional vidya gaem <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Don't see how they're going to improve that combat system... outside of overhauling the whole thing and redoing it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis lol
It's like taking a car out for a drive, hating it... but buying it anyway because you liked the paint job. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis That makes no sense though. 
I was "interested" in FFXV, until I played that demo. Issues with the game aren't fixable IMO. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Not sure how that works... if you play a shitty demo, but it's presented well... do you still get excited for a game? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis not really. Combat was real bad... TBF, I haven't liked FF character design since 9. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis "looks"... It played like shit, and the character design is shitty 90s emo weeb trash. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Don't really "get" why people are excited for FFXV. 
Maybe I should actually try and beat the boring AF demo... I guess. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis wait... wait... that was a bait post wasn't it. Fuck. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Someone is high AF. 
Combat and character design in FFXV is real bad. Hell there hasn't been a solid FF game in 2 generations <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NintendoTweet Still don't understand why that game isn't f2p, just to push amiibo &amp; amiibo cards. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis PSN Store update was shit... and I own everything there anyway. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> When does the eShop update again? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheFrugster You know what will be really funny... when it's better than MGS4... which is a pretty low bar. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 So does the limitations on loadout options... the inability to change w/o exiting matchmaking, and there's huge balance issues. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 I'm playing it. For some reason.
Also... why are people playing Splatoon... Matchmaking is faster than CoD most of the time. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NintendoTweet Plus... it gives me an excuse to finally beat Kirby and buy Woolly World. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NintendoTweet ummm just everything tbh. Hard to concentrate on much when you might have to run and deal with random baby stuff. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NintendoTweet Sorry... can't help it. PS4 games require too much thought and focus. Right now, I need dumb games. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I've figured out that Nintendo games are good to play if you have no desire to think while playing. They're the dumb games I played as a kid <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I played Splatoon again. https://t.co/V6o0jUwJkP <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I also get salty around Steam sales, because I've caught myself buying shit I shouldn't have just because "it's cheap". <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Average Joe Gamer, who buys 3-4 AAA titles a year would have to be insane to think that gaming on PC would be cheaper... even long term. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It is cheaper to game on PC assuming a couple of things; a) You buy an excessive amount of games, b) You don't keep your rig up to date. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It's almost time for a Steam Sale... AKA when Master Racers pretend that it's cheaper to game on PC. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Stealth___ Sort of unfortunate to be honest. The Smash roster already had enough FE characters. Would have been nice to see more variety. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Saying the Vita is dead is a little misleading, since it never really had life in the west... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch yup. Curious if anyone will actually buy them though... They didn't in the past. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheFrugster thx. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Hey, can I play some vidya games? No? OK... Fine. https://t.co/mhBfjgTtSo <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Flunkie TV looks sorta small. Must be a casual. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AltSeth ...you can oversexualize a pre-teen... but no way are you going to show adult genitals. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AltSeth For a culture that's so perv-y, they're super sexually repressed due to all the censorship. It's super weird... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Months... I knew about it back when Konami released MGS1 on the PS1. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AltSeth creepy weebs need something to fap to I guess... I fine with it being in Japan, because it's their culture... here though... nope. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> TFW the official Outlook app from MS won't connect to your corporate exchange. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Knack was the real 2013 GotY <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> So Android 6.0.1 not having the OG Mail app anymore has proven to be a bit of an issue. Exchange is basically unusable in the Gmail app... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AltSeth Most Miyamoto fans aren't old enough to have internet yet...let alone twitter. UR SAFE. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mp1990GAF @ETDragonPunch To be fair, PC gets it's fair share of trash ports... especially when they come from consoles to PC. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I've been up for almost 7hrs. It's 9am. I work til 4pm. 
Baby is trying to kill me. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Saying "No Vita, No Buy", if the Vita is your only console is like me saying I won't buy Halo because it's not on PS4. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis https://t.co/oT46Hc1jBK <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Love that when ever the PSBlog posts about an indie... all 9 remaining Vita owners start port begging and doing "no vita no buy" bullshit. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis or 4. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis https://t.co/Hg6LkkGoVc <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Kojima fans are the Dark Souls of fandoms. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Koji's last few games have been like that. Huge hype cycles... just to have people be edgy and hate it once it releases. Nice fans. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm super excited to watch all the Koji fans hype the fuck out of this new game for a couple of years... just to shit on it when it releases <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> People legitimately asking why Koji can't take Fox Engine with him, clearly don't understand how reality works. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Kojima is the George Lucas of vidya gaemz. Can't say anything negative, without a bunch of nerd coming for your throat. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis folks like bad writing... As long as it's not David Cage <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Might as well play a little Woolly World before work... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @PranooYY Shu being ice fucking cold <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Kojima's track record isn't great, when you consider his own fanbase hates half the games he's made... and hasn't played anything not MG <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Woke up to the news about Kojima being funded, at least in part, by Sony. Thought I was still asleep and having a nightmare. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It's crazy that it takes the Smash team 4+mths to dev a characters. They have tiny movements w/limited normals. Smash isn't a fighting game. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Too much focus on select franchises. 
Too many 3rd party guest, so they don't feel special.
Too many niche legacy characters are trophies. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I didn't really say much after the direct, but these new characters are examples of everything that was wrong w/Super Smash... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> On the plus side, I have managed to unlock almost everything in Mario Maker without doing the dumb calendar change. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Further proof that I've turned into a filthy casual... Wife took the baby upstairs, so I could be playing PS4... But I'm playing Wii U. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 kind of underwhelming... Thought there would be more. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> OK... When is cloud coming <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Out Xmas shopping... So I'll have to find out what I'm hate buying via twitter. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 you mean K Rool <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Shit I never thought I'd say. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Scanned my amiibo into Mario Maker and Woolly World. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 shows that NA has no taste... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Very much so, yes. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> So Mario Maker really doesn't give you any real tools to easily find levels made by "friends"
Sorry... LTTP... but what in the srs fuck. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis true story. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> IB4 Kojima &amp; Sony announce an 80mil Kickstarter campaign to make a game that's totally not Silent Hills <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> People are excited about this Kojima nonsense, but none of you ever bought or play any game that wasn't MGS from him... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Sony could fund 7 good games for the price of one Kojima game... Pls. Let MS have him, if they want him. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Sony already has David Cage in their pocket... they don't need anymore devs that think they can write well (and clearly can't) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> If Kojima ends up at Sony... it'll be the least surprising, and least exciting dev pick up of all time. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> And this is why PC is great... M I RITE. 2yrs, and the game is still a broke PoS. https://t.co/bCbm54A6Rh <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ...Isn't there a way to bypass the dumb tool locks in Mario Maker? Swear I read somewhere you could... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheFrugster @ItsameDennis Can't you just replace the battery? Those can be bought at retail. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Maybe I should just sell my PS4, and become a full fledged Nintendoyearold. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis No where... Might be able to order a replacement from Nintendo. Otherwise ur Wii U iz ded. Ironic and shitty, at the same time <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @wlatham92 More like INCREDIBLE DEAL...seriously though...they are basically using WoW as a guide for all this shit. And people will buy it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis ...but true <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 technically, it's salt coated in salt day <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I've also saved enough $$ to hate-buy the remaining Smash Characters, and the stages I'm missing. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Well. 
It's over.
In the past week and half, I've bought XCX, Yoshi... and now...Mario Maker.
It's been nice everyone. I'm clearly DED. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Everyone ruins everything for themselves because nothing can ever live up to their bullshit manufactured expectations. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I like Star Wars. I want the movie to be good. I just really think people buy too much into hype culture, and need to seriously CTFO. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @omek90 People just need to keep expectations in check...
Although people did go see Avatar about 50 times in the theatre. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Force Awakens could be great, but there's an equally good chance it could be the prequels again. People forget, Star Wars is for kids. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> JJ isn't a great director. Disney has a tendency of thinking the solution to everything is money and special effects. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> A bad movie can be entertaining the first time, if you don't know what will happen (think Michael Bay), but is still a bad movie at the end. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> People care WAY too much about spoilers.
A good movie is good even if you know every line of dialog, and every scene shot for shot. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Again, I like both games... they just aren't the type of games you would "marathon" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Woolly World is charming AF, but like Kirby, you seriously can't play more than a stage or 2 in a sitting w/o nodding off. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 being a baby... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @passthemstickss I have. It's pretty great. Gets a bit repetitive as you go on... But still great <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 good work, I'm proud of you <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Buy this, nerds https://t.co/IANiIkGA8p <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch card is sort of crap in constructed, only because so many legendaries are bad <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis oh... For PSVR. I think it'll get a standalone announcement in Feb/March. CES is too early, and E3 too late. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis probably about 7 PAX's <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I legitimately don't know what to do with $50 on the Google Play Store...Almost everything there is either free or garbage... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Man... so on top of getting $170 off the renewal price of my phone, I still got the $50 Google Play Store credit. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Remember kids; If you think any MGS game that isn't 3 is the best MGS, you're a dirty casual w/shit taste, and should probably just die. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheFrugster The Rising comment was pure bait, and I don't really expect most people to agree with me. I'm old and cranky. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Also... the bait was strong. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Cool story... 'cause I give a shit about your opinion. https://t.co/khhzDFb2h6 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Play as the studio head... "Time for crunch, sorry...you don't get to see your family" "Nameless developer will remember that" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis A Telltale Series about making a Telltale Series. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheFrugster V is the only game in the series, since 1, that I can say I enjoyed any of. MGS2 &amp; 3 border on unplayable (mechanically) IMO. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @omek90 Based on GAF, you're not a real gamer if you play games at all. Real GAEMERZ just bitch about games on the internet. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheFrugster MGS-fanbase is sorta strange. So many seem to hate everything that isn't MGS1-3... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 Make sense...all indie-looking games are pro-Sony lol. It is the indiestation 4 after all. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 You missed a great section with Pele... that was literally the worst thing since Jamie Kennedy at E3 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Honestly, V is the only game in the Solid series that's remotely playable... but whatevs. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 yup... don't you remember the reveal at EA's awful E3 presser...? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The best Metal Gear is Rising. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> If I don't spend half my day on Twitter, I do too much work, and make my boss look bad. Well... worse. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheSharkSurname Finance usually trumps logic, especially with crown corps. Opening separate locations just doesn't make sense financially <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GuerrillaDawg https://t.co/sFnc5pyimR <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GuerrillaDawg Splinter Cell. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheSharkSurname I'm assuming they'll be operated as a crown corp... so attaching them to the LCBO makes sense financially. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> also... Nexus 6P is real nice phone. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I mean, I've only had Marshmallow (technically 6.0.1) for a day... but I can't think of a time when I'd really use it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I don't really understand why you'd ever use Google on Tap... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Triple Gay devs aren't much better anymore... they just bullshit w/fake dates better... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis -2pts for an XB1 exclusive. -1 for a Nintendo 1st party title. +2pts for Witness mention. 9/10 Too much AAA tho <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis True story. I'm fucking awful. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis https://t.co/5z8pQFfRqw <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheGameFreakGuy not especially. There's some solid PC to tablet ports... I just don't play handhelds enough to warrant the expense. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheGameFreakGuy Sorry... my iPad/phone is more than sufficient for my mobile gaming needs now a days. I'm fine w/a hybrid system though. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis I'm a terrible person, but my list is god tier. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I guess my Nintendo boycott is dead. Might as well prep to buy the NX... (as long as it's not a portable) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis TLG still top on that list XD <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Joesff I've got 4 or 5 amiibo that my wife bought me, back when I thought Nintendo would do something with them... all out of the package. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GuerrillaDawg Not bad list... I approve of most of these games...Gud Dawg. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Joesff Because like amiibo... the game might, but probably won't be, a collectors item. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @iAsobu That's such a terrible name... I'm probably still going to buy it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> What's that dumb SMTxFE weeb-extravaganza actually called... in Engrish? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I've already paid for my copy of Unravel, so I don't much care when it releases... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 K Rool, Waluigi, Urban Champion Guy, and the Kid from The Wizard w/the Power Glove. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> In the past week I bought 2 first party games... and enjoyed them... and an amiibo. This is what happens when @ItsameDennis goes to 'Murica. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 What would be the worst possible DLC pack... one so bad that you wouldn't auto-buy it, and the amiibo? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @wlatham92 *correction* The progression in DICE shooters is awful. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 What if the only character is King K Rool <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @glottis8 Well... In theory it is. I just don't really have any where to put it, where I'd ever actively use it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @glottis8 I don't enjoy playing games on PC (it's off and unhooked), and I sold my Xbox One <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Joesff It's because a chunk of the fanbase spends more time telling Sony Ponies how shitty they are... versus playing actual vidya gaemz. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Does anyone still play any of the following (online)?
Mario Kart 8
Smash
Mario Maker (upload levels &amp; shit) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Joesff It's for the best if you do... Every impressions I've heard has said it's bad... like reaaaaaallllll bad. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I've played more Wii U (not just XCX) than I have PS4 over the past week or so...OffTV is pretty handy for when the baby is sleeping. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I need a moment... this news is too shocking for me. https://t.co/Q88GFt9icx <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Tomorrow... assuming the Taxman doesn't totally destroy my bonus, I'll probably LttP buy Mario Maker. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @passthemstickss It's making me dislike modern JRPGs a little bit less...so that's something. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Gonna add a couple of Wii U games to my 2016 release tracker.
I don't think Star Fox is gonna be one of them. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GuerrillaDawg XCX feels more refined in that sense. AI party members seem a lot less fucking stupid. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GuerrillaDawg pretty big understatement. I played a bit of the OG release on Dolphin. Still didn't love it. AI/combat was kind of clunky. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GuerrillaDawg Honestly, I thought I was going to hate it (because I really don't like XC3D)... but I'm really liking it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GuerrillaDawg Don't feel bad. I've played for about 12hrs or so now... and I'm part way through Chapter 4. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm probably going to buy Twilight Princess HD, because I think the game gets a bad rap because of the intro sequence. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GuerrillaDawg how far are you (what chapter?) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GuerrillaDawg Too much of a hassle w/a newborn, even if he is bottle fed. By January, we might be able to leave him w/someone for a few hrs <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GuerrillaDawg At least you get to see it... I'll probably have to wait til Jan, or when it hits Netflix in Canada next year. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @komarekk33 to me? Yeah. Section.80 and good kid are 2 of the best hip hop albums of the past 10+ yrs. New one is no where near that level. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> My biggest disappointment of 2015 isn't even a game. It's the Kendrick album. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I like the game.
I just think it's over priced.
Like Mario Maker, which should be $30-$40 tops, but isn't... Because people bought it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Early impressions of Woolly World put it on the same level as Kirby &amp; the Rainbow Curse. Game should have been a budget release tbh. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> XCX has made me believe that I don't hate JRPGs, the Wii U, or Nintendo. I hate the 3DS. Fuck that PoS. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Ffs... My phone barely fits in the pocket of my work khakis... #shortpersonproblems <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch Man... There was 0 chance that XCX was going to chart. It'll be pretty amazing if it sells more than a couple 100k lifetime <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Joesff lay down in traffic... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch I bought that game twice... (Mostly because my PC is off, and super inconvenient to use) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> What do ya know... Woolly World is pretty charming. Controls are still a little off, but that's how Yoshi rolls. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheGameFreakGuy it's the only place it's gonna be... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I bought Yoshi's Woolly World, because I bought my wife a pick Yoshi amiibo for her stocking...and that's the story I'm going with. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Enjoying the new phone. 6P gets my seal of approval. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I bought my first amiibo today.
I also bought another Wii U game.
Suicide is likely my best option at this point. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Got my new phone...for a quarter of what I expected to pay... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Unruly baby killing my XCX time. He's clearly upset that I'm playing shitty Wii U games. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Real Life effect of the FFVII theme on PS4 https://t.co/ceg7DOQGGZ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch Probably shouldn't be. China wasn't very good. It was like Mark of the Ninja, only a lot worse. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch Wait... is Undertale a SHMUP? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It's not a matter of if I get thrown up on... it's a matter of when... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> One of these days I'll actually beat Wonderful 101... maybe when they fix the shitty controls. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheFrugster manga is for weebs and pedos. ( srsly, I just don't have the time) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis so.... How do I get in on the Crytek payoffs... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'll never beat 3D World because searching out green stars is the worst <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis guess we'll find out next gen, won't we <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis :| Dat's sheet. Gonna be stuck playing Pii U even longer now :| <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NintendoTweet If by current gen, we mean PS360... and by best, we mean most powerful... sure. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NintendoTweet No. Probably not <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GuerrillaDawg @ItsameDennis My newborns name is Shepard. He's Nintendoyearsold <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis I think I logged into the eShop, and had to go make a bottle up for the baby when I went to go buy Xenoblade. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GuerrillaDawg I added you... NNid is godofrawr <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> well then... #WiiU https://t.co/zUYkxEjCNc <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I give Nintendo a lot of shit for abandoning the Wii U, but I do think it's the stronger of their 2 systems. 3DS library is so mediocre. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Earned 1 PSN trophy (1 bronze) in Nuclear Throne - https://t.co/p4uUPiZ39W <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Put that shit in her stocking for Xmas... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm probably going to buy my first amiibo because my wife really likes Yarn Yoshi, and im gonna end up with the game anyway. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Local stores had a shit ton of amiibo, but were sold out of most of the prime Star Wars DI figs... What fucking witchcraft is this... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Nexus 6P is on sale this weekend. 
I'm eligible for upgrade tomorrow.
Normally $220... On for $50. Nice. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis nah, cause that would mean both are shit... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I've played my Wii U more in the past few days, than I had in the past few months. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @omek90 I like SFV's look better. T7 is sorta fugly... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 That looks a lot like the 75 crappy Mario characters in Smash. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis lol good to know... my copy has been paid for... like a year. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Sound track in XCX is pretty rough... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis My friends uncle said that Sony was making games for NX, and was gonna give up on the shitty indiestation 4. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis sounds like bullshit tbh... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @OriginalFunko: RT &amp; follow @OriginalFunko for a chance to win a Bobby Singer Pop! #Supernatural https://t.co/pRBOzrNeyP <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GuerrillaDawg If the XCX bundle comes with a disk copy of the game... you might want to dl the content packs to cut down the load times. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GuerrillaDawg PLS B EXCITE. 
Srsly though, if you think the PSN is slow... wait 'til you see the Nintendo Network. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Might be me, but the controls, specifically in combat (when it comes to limb targeting) feel a bit fiddly. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> TTK in combat vs what's essentially trash mobs, still takes too long, but it's not as bad as in XC (thankfully). <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Have about 4hrs or so played so far... and I've accomplished basically nothing, because I'm just fucking around. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Played some more XCX... because newborns wake you up too fucking early... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis nah man, Splatoon is still shit. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> So... I definitely don't hate XCX. Played a few hours... By this point, I was already annoyed by XC3D. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> tried to make my character look super emo...but still a little anime #WiiU https://t.co/f0zmAAJbZH <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The scale of the world is impressive, but textures, models, and overall fidelity are probably the worst I've seen this gen. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Early impressions of XCX...
I don't hate it.
AI is improved, which helps combat.
Game "feels" more anime.
Game is real fugly. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> So my XCX character looks sort of emo, and sort of anime... But all PS2 gen character model. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AltSeth sounds great... :| <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It's time. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @omek90 7 copies <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GuerrillaDawg tis OK Dawg. Life is dark <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Legit surprised XB1 lost. They throw the kitchen sink at consumers, and still can't catch much of a break. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Justinator5000 it was a calculated risk, and I'm sure MS is more upset, since I'm sure they paid good cash for the exclusivity. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AsukaLSorhyu Great movie. One of my favs. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis That means a lot to me Dennis... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @PranooYY yup. It's one of the Avatars that came with the SFV season pass... :| <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> As much as I shit on SM3DW... I think it works better, at least mechanically, than either Galaxy. Wii controls feel off. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> For lazy folks;
NNID - Godofrawr
PSN - Jaded_Dragon <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I've gone ahead and added my NNID to my Bio, if anyone is interested in adding me (since I might actually play the thing now) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NintendoTweet As long as the AI is less trash than in XC, I think it'll be fine. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NintendoTweet burned waaaayyyyy too many times by Yoshi games. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> man... I forgot how slow the Nintendo Network is. Makes the PSN feel next gen speeds. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NintendoTweet At least part of that is real. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Welp... I bought Xenoblade Chronicles X.
Last hate-buy of 2015.
It's also my "last chance" at JRPGs... if I don't hate it... I'll buy P5. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis So long friend. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis @omek90 lol Nope, you're not. Fanboi wars are usually about proving which person is more closed minded when it comes to games <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis @omek90 But Dennis... Sunset Overdrive is the defining game of this generation, and 3 Forza's in 2yrs is wonderful <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @omek90 PS4 iz oful anD evary budy nowz eet.
Kotaku has been pushing the pro-'Murica "XBOX is the Best box" shit for a while now. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis and 3DS. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @glottis8 I was fine with Gwent. It's the combat in TW3 I don't like... or the crafting systems... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Don't feel like Oculus netting Eve is that big of a deal.
It's sort of a niche game/experience (like absolutely everything VR) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @passthemstickss You've probably never had good hummus. I used to think the same... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> A few more rounds didn't change my opinion, that Splatoon isn't very good at what it's trying to be... which is a TPS. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> There's still huge weapon balance issues. And gear customization is semi-broken. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Controls in Splatoon still feel really jank-y and unenjoyable <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Literally everyone in Matchmaking is Japanese. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> wtf am I even doing with my life... #Splatoon #WiiU https://t.co/ap74pakx7I <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> We went out and bought a new fake tree from Walmart (on clearance). It's nice enough, so I'm happy. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Nintendo is just lying to you, like when your dad told your mom he was going to get smokes 20yrs ago, and never came back. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Star Fox still looks like an abomination, and Zelda U is Zelda NX. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Pokken is probably the only Wii U game that real, and coming in 2016, that I think looks like it's worth buying. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> My updated eShop wishlist is X, Yoshi, and stupid fucking Mario Maker. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The single player mode in PvZGW2 sounds basically like the co-op mode from 1, but with AI. And an extra $40 CAD on the price tag. Pass. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @wlatham92 Really looking forward to the game. It looks like all the good stuff about Minecraft, but with personality. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I feel gross now, so I'm going to bath in gasoline, and set myself on fire. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I even played a little Wii U, and bought a couple of the discounted VC titles (OoT and S&amp;P) since they were $2. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> PS4 could never figure out the size of the screen, and I'd loose stuff to the edges. Wii U doesn't have that issue at all... which is nice. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> PS4 is hooked back up to the big screen, and the Wii U is connected to the little TV at my desk. Oddly enough, the Wii U works better w/it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Joesff Minimum wage is really the only thing that would hurt small business, but that's a reality in most 1st world countries. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Joesff Depends. If it's done properly (which it won't 'cause GOP won't let it), big business would foot most of the bill. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Joesff unless you're rich, I'm not sure you really understand how socialism works (and Bernie is socialist, not communist) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch Can I port beg for iOS? X-Com works there... unlike on console. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch The effects of a shit holiday line up. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I keep forgetting about Chasm... That game will probably be my Axiom Verge next year (meaning my GotY) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ugh... I actually want to by Xenoblade X now. The lack of sleep is getting to me. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I did a disgusting thing last night. 
I updated my eShop "wishlist" on my Wii U, since I'll actually play it once I move it upstairs. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> My sleep cycles now work in 3hr blocks. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Baby hates Taylor Swift. Wife put it on, and he cried... That's my boy. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 I'm talking about her vids (sorry)... He husband/partner/whatthefuckever is the writer of the shows. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 its because Anita isn't the writer behind FF, or at least not the principle writer. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Re-Core is being made by a studio that's never made a good game, and Armature. #Inafuneiztrash <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> "They tap the top Metroid Prime guys to make a game for them."
GTFO w/that shit Kotaku. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The Kotaku "State of the *console*" pieces for PS4 and XB1 are pure flame-bait trash. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 fuck rent and food. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 Why is both not an option. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis How do you even watch TV, you can't experience it without Kinect™ for your Xbox One All in One Entertainment System™ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis TV is for Xbots. Go talk to Kinect about that shit... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Fuck Kiefer <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @CodeRedShell Downwell is probably mine. Or Room 3. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @CodeRedShell X. For Wii U. NA didn't get the VC release AFAIK. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MonsefMA Up until Tahm Kench, I owned every single champ. I just tried to ask for no AD carry, because it's my weakest position. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @MonsefMA Ranked is a little better, until you get to Plat rank. Normal pub matches are stupid because people don't give a shit... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MonsefMA My PC has been powered off for the better part of 5mths. Also... community is cancerous, and I can't be bothered with ranked play. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MonsefMA I used to play. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Excel is terrible. Don't let anyone tell you differently. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> meh... I'm gonna end up buying Xenoblade, just to have something to play in bed (because fuck my 3DS) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Not sure I agree w/Lara Croft Go being iOS GotY. For whatever reason, I found the game a lot more boring than Hitman Go. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AltSeth I can't be bothered. Honestly, I can't be bothered to post on most GAF threads... it's just a giant circle jerk. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Earned 2 PS4 trophies (2 bronze) in FINAL FANTASY VII - https://t.co/p4uUPiHrLm <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Witcher vs Mass Effect, and Witcher will win because of CDPR dickriding and everyone hates EA/Bioware because they're edgy fucks. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> https://t.co/znIJeY10e6 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @johnnydork No love for death's gambit? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @omek90 agreed. Indies are hard though, because they almost never have solid dates until right before release (at least on console) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @PranooYY same. It's on my list too... https://t.co/SSoKpYm2DD <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Dennis shits on Alan Wake... excited for Quantum Break. GG <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @PranooYY Props for the ME:A mention. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @johnnydork I still haven't watched that footage. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm looking forward to UC4... there's just a load of stuff that excites me more, at least conceptually. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @omek90 I don't know tbh. Feel like the hype cycle for the game has dragged on. I want to play it, but I'm more excited for other stuff. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> TFW Uncharted 4 really isn't in your top 10 games for next year. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @SuperiorShibata @Mattmanver2 I was wrong... it's Feb 2011. Almost 5yrs at this point. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @SuperiorShibata @Mattmanver2 Sort of my point. 5+yr old piece of tech, less than half the price, with multiple hw revisions... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Next week, in gaming magazines. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 Quote is retarded though... "So far, on a global basis, Nintendo 3DS has sold more hardware than PS4 and Xbox One—combined" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @passthemstickss Nope. It's the only reason I'm playing the game tbh, <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @wlatham92 Well... Wii U is dead, so they have to start up the hype train for Smash Mobile for NX. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> This is the second day this week that I've had to wake up at 3:30am because the baby decided that it was party time. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AltSeth That's why he raised the price of the meds... to get the new Wu hotness. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm gonna end up buying the stupid Smash characters, even though I don't particularly like the game <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I probably hate the fact that gamers gave Witcher 3 a free pass, more than I hate the game. Game launched in a worse state than AC Unity. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Both games were technically flawed, to partially broken at launch... 
But that only means something to gamers when it's from a big AAA pub. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Witcher 3 didn't deserve GotY.
Neither did Bloodborne. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheGameFreakGuy It's because people have taste... and he's the only Link that was capable of visible emotion. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Some of those were bait, some of those were legit. 
I legitimately think OG Xbox was the high point for MS, and it's been downhill since. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ok... I'm done. Free breakfast at work... so I was bored. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> https://t.co/xrj3OL3eVy <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> https://t.co/C0eX2lRhRg <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @bfletchtone The bait is strong. I really don't like the 3DS, or the majority of it's library... but it's better than the VB <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> https://t.co/u3uJPEKjUw <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Justinator5000 The brutal load times have basically ruined the game for me...hoping for a patch sometime soon. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @Granabanana Combat in Chronicles (at least in XC3D) was terrible though. AI made the game frustrating and unenjoyable. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 To be fair... everything is better than Splatoon <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @CodeRedShell I don't think I'm wrong :) Poor narrative, stale combat, overly simplistic. It's a child-friendly JRPG. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Souls III just looks like Souls II+BB. These games should be given more time, so they're special. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I sort of wish that FROM would dial back on the Souls games, and make something else... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @PranooYY PC I hope? Console port isn't great. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @bfletchtone good to know. Do you know if it supports offTV play? That's really the only way I play my Wii U <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Started Her Story.
Don't really understand what I'm doing. Still... It's more engaging than a lot of games this year. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Also, I'm kind of afraid that this will be like Witcher 3, where I'd be buying a game I know I won't like. It's why I passed on Mario Maker. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm still considering Xenoblade... It's just that impressions have been all over the place. I'm also concerned that the combat is still bad. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I have more than enough $$ coming this check to finish Xmas shopping, and maybe even buy myself something... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The real GotY is bitching about the games other people like, and shitting on them for liking them. It's definitely the most fun I had... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> My Wii U makes random noises from time to time...It's kind of odd. I can only assume it's because of the dust... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Her Story is on sale on iOS for $2. I wanted to try it... Don't have an excuse not to now. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch not really a Souls fan, but combat was one of my bigger mechanical complaints about The Witcher. Feels janky. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Saying "The only JRPG I like, is Pokemon" is like saying "The only thing I like to eat is elephant shit". You like the biggest, worst, thing <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I turned off my PS4 to play Candy Crush. What the fuck is happening to me. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheGameFreakGuy gaming laptops are for upper middle class white kids with too much money in their trust funds. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheGameFreakGuy then you'll spend significantly more than all your consoles combined... And lose the only real advantage to PC gaming... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheGameFreakGuy LOLOLOLOL PC will cost you more than all your consoles combined, assuming you want to play absolutely anything decent <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AltSeth fast combat, disable random encounter, infinite health/magic/breaker <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mp1990GAF lol To be fair, you're literally the only person I've ever heard say that it was that good. I know it's not as bad as the 3DS one <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mp1990GAF I bought New Yoshi's Island, which was boring AF... no way was I gonna spend $80 on another Yoshi game. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mp1990GAF No, I haven't. It's not about fanboy-ism, it's that Nintendo legitimately hasn't made a good Yoshi game since SMW2... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I am 100% using the "cheats" in FFVII on PS4 because I can't fucking be bothered to deal with atypically 90s JRPG grind BS <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mp1990GAF Nah... Not possible. There hasn't been a half decent Yoshi game in almost 2 decades. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It's petty, but I simply don't have the time to waste 2 and half minutes waiting for the fucking game to load. Shame too, 'cause it's fun. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Just Cause 3 has overtaken Witcher 3, as my more regrettable purchase of the year... Load times suck all the fun out of the game. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> You know your Pita restaurant is legit, when they mispronounce Gyro... and you have to correct them. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Dad's alone time involves Pita Land for dinner, and some Just Cause 3 on the big screen... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Wife is out at her work Xmas party... even though she's on mat leave... because people wanted to see the baby. So I'm alone. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 I liked The Order. I also didn't have fucked up expectations of a studio that made a couple PSP games though... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch I sold mine. Handhelds are for pedophiles <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> got my quarterly bonus report...
feel the need to buy vidya gaemz now...
and a new phone on the weekend...
gud timez <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> 3DS I just need to stop being lazy, and sell... 
Wife keeps giving me a hard time about it though. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ...I'm at a point where I either need to buy something for my Wii U, or consider selling it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Even though Xenoblade X looks like an expansion of everything I hated about the original, I'm still considering getting it... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis It'll be made by Platinum... and be trash... like Starfox <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis I don't even know why people would buy the NX. Last 2 Nintendo home consoles have been mediocre to bad. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> TFW you see people buying Wii U's, when the system is already laid to rest in it's coffin. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Joesff nope <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis https://t.co/ctyS6dRk7N <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 Yeah. The KQ episodes are 3-4hrs long though, vs the Telltale 2-2.5 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis I didn't know that Nintendoyearolds were old enough to use the internet unsupervised... dafuq are those kids doin' on Gaf <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis how to make a cover story about VR not look fucking retarded. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> EU PSN has had Shadow of the Beast, and Alienation up for pre-pay for weeks. WTF are you doing Sony NA. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> UFC 2, Lego Avengers, and Resident Evil 0 are up for pre-order on the PSN. I want none of those games. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> PSN Holiday sale is pretty good. If you don't own Tales from the Borderlands, Resogun, Journey, or OlliOlli2, you should now. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Kotaku really doesn't like Playstation much <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GuerrillaDawg mistakes have been made. How the fuck is a Wii U 280 euro... Did Nintendo at least take you out for dinner first? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> AC Chronicles China sat somewhere between mediocre, and not good. No way am I buying the follow ups. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I really hope Trump is done. I really don't like America, but even that shit hole deserves better than Hitler Lite. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 It's what you get for being pro-Nintendo... Kaz knows mutha fucka... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Earned 1 PSN trophy (1 bronze) in Nuclear Throne - https://t.co/p4uUPiZ39W <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @wlatham92 I've had it on PC for years... It's a solid rogue-like. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @wlatham92 They were probably using modern Blizzard's WoW exp as a guide. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Renton127 I'll be shocked if it makes 2017 tbh. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Renton127 0 chance it actually comes out next year. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I briefly considered buying Xenoblade X, simply because I feel like I should at least give the Wii U one last shot... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis @Mattmanver2 good point. I still haven't played Beyond. I assume it's shit because the internet said so. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @wlatham92 Honestly, I didn't even know it released... That movie was in production hell for years, wasn't it? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 @ItsameDennis The question remains; Will the game be good, and will David Cage over-Cage the game. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 It'll probably look better tbh. Graphics is their thing... Also, won't have to worry about the same level of action. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Shame it's PC only. https://t.co/qfMf9j9moi <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis CUS ITZ iMPORTANT AND UR A FIGIT FOR THINKING ITS NOT FFS DEnnIs WTF IZ WrOnG WId U U XBOT <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Also... Shitty Mages... stop trying to rely so heavily on double FB kill combos. Trying to survive is more important than trying to kill. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It's real depressing when you lose a match in HS to a garbage deck, just because of RNG and a bad opening hand. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Face Pally. ummm. ok. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 Reviews make it sound like a very safe, and by the numbers M&amp;L game. Not sure what people expected. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I can judge if you're a bad person or not, based on your opinion about Nuclear Throne. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @wlatham92 So it's Fallout 3, but with better controls, or Skyrim w/guns. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Justinator5000 Unfortunately, a lot of the newer MOBAs are good... but the playerbases are afraid to try something not DOTA2/LOL <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 it's great, but a bit pretentious <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Actually turned on my Wii U. The world is ending. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Can't just shit on JRPG fans alone though. Literally ever niche game fan group acts like this when a dev tries to change things up a bit. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Renton127 I think 100hr games are impractical for adults with jobs and kids. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> JRPG fans being awful. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 Wonder Swan <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AW_141 gud. You need screen shake in your life <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis there's also people out there that have never played a Ueda game... Oh... Wait... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Pixielated77 it's not exactly practical to play 2 or 3 hours a week of a 100+hr JRPG. You forget the story before you're halfway through. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 each episode will be 5mins of Cloud looking sad listening to My Chemical Romance...And cost FIVE HUNDRED AND NINTY-NINE DOLLARS <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @glottis8 its an artistic experience designed to move forward the medium. If you only like traditional games, than yes, it's not for you. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheFrugster UC is like the TR reboots. It's about the spectacle, and (more so with UC) the story. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheFrugster Seriously though, I love UC (except 1, which is sort of poop)...and it is special, but I get why people dislike it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheFrugster eet iz. All other gaemz r sheet. EXCEPT TLOU WHCIH IS BEST OF ALL TIME FUCK HALO AND MARi0!!!! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheFrugster Uncharted is da best series of life and if you don't agree ur just a giant Nintendoyearold or xbot wid bad taste in vidya gaemz <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Ok... so now I'm a bit more interested in that PS4 release... https://t.co/ZRWwG1krla <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @wlatham92 It's been long enough, that I might as well. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 So you're almost done... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AltSeth I was listening to podcasts a lot... Sort of ran out of stuff I wanted to listen to though. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AltSeth I haven't listened to music willingly in about 3mths or so. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @JimKWeaver @Stealth___ I'm not talking episodes of 2-3hrs like Telltale. I think JRPGs could work as 5-6 10-15hr episodes. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @JimKWeaver @Stealth___ I 100% disagree with that, assuming the narrative was built to properly suit episodic gaming. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @JimKWeaver @Stealth___ But they want people to play the games as is, w/o any changes to make the genre more approachable. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @JimKWeaver @Stealth___ Unfortunately, you're probably right. Gamers don't tend to take kindly to things that open games up for more players <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I don't really understand how I went from "I don't give a shit about VR" to "I'm gonna trying and buy PSVR day one" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @JimKWeaver @Stealth___ Not trying to say length is the only issue, just that it scares away some people that are already fans of the style. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 "New Amiibo" Salt
"New Metroid, that's not Metroid" Salt
"New, new 3DS" Salt
"Moar Salt for Wii U" Salt <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @JimKWeaver @Stealth___ 2/2 or at least fear the time investment enough to steer clear of the genre. JRPGs have a number of hills to climb. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @JimKWeaver @Stealth___ I can agree with that.... but I know plenty of people that like anime, but lack the time for JRPGs...1/2 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 you know you could use that image after every single Nintendo announcement... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Backwards compatibility and cross-buy are courtesies, not rights. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Honestly, Cross-buy was the worst thing Sony could have ever done, because it created a sense of self-entitlement for ever PS consumer. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Nice to see that people are still pissing and moaning about the PS2 to PS4 games. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Joesff With how slow the eShop is... I could see how that could take all weekend :} <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Joesff I assume by "play", you mean power on, and stare at Waru Waru Plaza <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 man... that's rough... even by my standards... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @Snowden: Ever have one of those days where you just wanted to play Fallout 4, but somebody says something so dumb you have to get on Tw… <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheGameFreakGuy Overpriced Minecraft. Obama. SJW ruining sexism and oppression in video games. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AltSeth If I end up buying that many games in the rest of the PS4s life span, it'll be a miracle. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Technically 262*
*includes PS+ titles, and breaks apart collections (i.e. Handsome Collection, Metro Redux, etc) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I have just over 260 "no gaemz" on my PS4. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @wlatham92 Nephew is 8. He could tell almost immediately. Largely because the PE controls are really clunky. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @fourhman I'm sure. I'm still impressed that 4J does a better job getting the game to run on consoles, than Mojang does on PC. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @fourhman Do many of those people exist? Wii U is the last, and most expensive place to try Minecraft, if you didn't know what it was. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @fourhman One would assume, at this point, that they just didn't want to try Minecraft. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @JimKWeaver @Stealth___ Breaking that experience into 10-15hr chucks, every 3mths or so, would make the genre more approachable to people. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @JimKWeaver @Stealth___ Having a linear, narrative focused game, that 50-100hrs is too intimidating for a lot of gamers. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @JimKWeaver @Stealth___ The difference w/JRPGs is they're generally a linear narrative experience, vs an open world to fool around in. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> After saying that I wouldn't buy as many open world games... I'll almost certainly buy Yakuza 0. I played the Japanese demo... it's great. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Why is the Wii U version of Minecraft the most expensive version? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> .@TheWordofRawr sorry...guess it's just 2pts... but still... seems a bit extreme, given PC has mostly the same probs w/o a high end rig. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Not sure I agree w/IGN chopping 3pts off the Just Cause 3 score on console... not over load times and some FPS issues. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @wlatham92 I had to explain to my nephew that Minecraft Pocket was trash... now he plays on PC... even if it barely runs on his craptop. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @JimKWeaver @Stealth___ I don't like side content, so yeah, GTAV was about 20-25hrs when I beat it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Minecraft finally releasing on the hardware that matches it's target demographic...(other than iOS) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Sony needs to announce price/date for PSVR at CES. That seems like the best place to do it... otherwise, a one-off show in Feb. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> If I can keep my AAA purchases down in 2016, I might buy Persona 5. FFXV is a definite no-buy. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @bfletchtone Rather than buying a ton of AAA open-world time sinks... I might trim down to 1-2 throughout the year. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @bfletchtone It's not just the baby... I feel like I could invest my game time playing "more". Sinking 100hrs in 1 thing seems like a waste. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mp1990GAF Not shocked at all. XC3D on 3DS didn't sell well... domestically, or in Japan. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm realizing pretty quickly, that the days of me buying huge AAA open world games that take a 100hrs is pretty much gone. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Telltale, and their inability to create/adhere to a proper release schedule has likely soured people to episodic gaming... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @JimKWeaver @Stealth___ GTA is about 20-30hrs. Also, most Western (non-PC) RPGs aren't story focused, so there's nothing lost if you lapse <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> FFVII port might be playable because of speed boost, and the ability to disable encounters. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Arrive at work for 7:30... And I've already been up for almost 4hrs. Yes... I am eating that Xmas chocolate sitting in the office now. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Stealth___ how many of those aren't Pokemon or Final Fantasy. And where do those sales sit w/o the absurd numbers from Japan. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Stealth___ compared to western RPGs, on console... Sure they are. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Stealth___ JRPGs are struggling in the west, because people don't have 100+ hrs to sink into a game. Or are just too scared to start <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Stealth___ I actually disagree. Creating an episodic JRPG makes the genre immediately more approachable for people who lack the time. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It's sort of like how a lot of people can forgive Miyamoto's touch on more recent games, because he defined their childhood. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Tim Schafer can shit on my carpet, and I'll still love the guy. He was involved in some of my favourite games growing up. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Regular reminder that my path in gaming differs significantly from a lot of people. I had a Master System and moved to PC in 88. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I suppose my lack of love for FFVII has to do with my age, and it not being anywhere near my first JRPG. (that was Phantasy Star on SMS) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Starting a play through of FFVII doesn't get me excited for FFVIIR, but it definitely makes me more interested in the concept. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @Joesff @Johnnyebs06 well, its not on the Nintendo... And that's the only other console this gen. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis is GNOG there? It's the VR puzzle games I'm interested in. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 I can live on Sony's indie line up alone... So... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Renton127 $11 w/PS+ discount <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 it's basically 360 commercials from last gen <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 no <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Meh, fuck it... Bought FFVII <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ...I want to buy FFVII for some reason. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 so play UC3... It's better than all of them. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @GuerrillaDawg Nintendoyearolds.... Always them. Sony fanboys are just old 360 xbot converts... So whatevs <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AltSeth I've only ever played a handful of PS2 games... So pretty much anything would be for me... If I had time/funds <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheFrugster I actually agree with the TW3 comment. Game is no where near as good as people make it out to be. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NintendoTweet @SuperNintendad I actually owned all the ND Crash games (physically) until a year ago or so. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Me: I'm not gonna buy any PS2 games for PS4
Real Me: nah, don't got time for that stuff... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Me: I'm not going to buy more games.
Real Me: I'm gonna buy Nuclear Throne, Fat Princess, and the SFV Pass...and maybe other stuff later. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @SuperNintendad OK... No one likes what Crash became, after ND was bought by Sony, and Activision took over <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Fun Fact: no one actually likes Crash Bandicoot. They just want a new game to have it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> (and it's only 4th, because the first 3 are NES games, 8 is garbage, and the series is dead after 9) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> All the nerds running out to buy the 4th best Final Fantasy game. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> When are the good games going up the PSN... I don't want the shitty PC port of FFVII thx <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Asked Telus 3x last week when I could upgrade my phone via TUp. All 3x times was given that wrong information. Sure glad I paid for this :| <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Nnk2 comes w/o Ghibli... So hard pass <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Also worth noting that Full Throttle is my least fav OG LucasArts game. Rather have pretty much anything else. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @wlatham92 except it's the FFXV system by the looks of it.... which feels real bad. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> No clue how people still manage to have any excitement for the turds that SE drops now...It's been a decade (at least) since a solid game. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Watched that FFVIIR trailer... hard pass. It looks like new Squeenix, which means it's going to be awful, like FFXV <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Forgot that I could be playing the DOOM alpha right now, but I'd literally rather be doing anything else... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Sony just needs to update the store now so I can get fucking Nuclear Throne for the 15th time. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @wlatham92 I just meant about how people shit on Ni No Kuni 2... and beg for more Dark Cloud. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @omek90 Both of those titles are to "big" for PSX. That's E3 size stuff. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> TL shows that a lot of people still don't really understand WTF PSX is, and who it's for. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @omek90 ...ur high. WTF would it take to get an 8 or 9 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> PSX isn't the right show to debut big AAA first party releases, because it's essentially PAX for Sony Ponys. The mainstream press there. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Dark Cloud probably isn't as good as you remember it being. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Every day that passes w/o more Crash games, is a good day. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch Crash was trash. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @wlatham92 literally the only Baseball title with the MLB license <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @browland1 4 &amp; 5 are better too. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @johnnydork meh. It's OK. It was the beginning of the end for Squares character design. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I really don't understand peoples love for FFVII. 4-6, and 9 are all significantly better games. ChronoTrigger is better than all of them. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm missing Alex getting confirmed for SFV... Who the fuck cares about FFVIIR (its made by modern trash SE). Alex is GOAT SF character <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GuerrillaDawg (also, I've played a bunch of Battleborn, and its pretty solid) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GuerrillaDawg man... hots, Hearthstone ads both unbalanced piles o'poop. WoW hasn't been good in 3 expansion. Blizz iz ded <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GuerrillaDawg which means its better than modern Blizz :} <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch (spoiler... He's already gone) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Joesff its probably Segas fault. I'm sure the budget was slashed to fuck. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Battleborn is a pretty solid game... It'll be better when people aren't shit at it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Joesff technically they didn't make Aliens. It was outsourced <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NintendoTweet I care more about Battlefront than any trash from modern Square. FFXV feels real bad to play... So 7R will too <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> CoD will sell 10x what the FFVII remake will... Keep being out of touch gaemerz... Don't fucking change one bit <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @GuerrillaDawg @ETDragonPunch ur probably an Arcane mage... Need less than 3 buttons, or ur paws can't handle it <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch I mained a hunter for a while...fuk ur judgments <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @SuperNintendad probably none. Barely have time for my new games right lol <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> why are people portbegging for Below... it'll come to ps4 eventually. its not a full pub deal like Ori <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TELUSsupport yep. I get all other communication from TELUS w/o any problems. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @notaxation: Sony is giving PS4 players PS2 games with Trophies for $10-$15 and people still complain. Because they'll complain about li… <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @glottis8 Keep in mind, MP graphics are knocked down to up the FPS. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AltSeth It feels like a faster version of the TLoU MP... with a bit of extra silliness. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Finally tried a round of UC4 MP. I... I... ummm... actually kinda like it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mp1990GAF dats a tad extreme son. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mp1990GAF https://t.co/qRo8PHO4vw <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Should Nintendo/Sony offer free upgrades to emulated titles, if you owned them on a previous platform? Sure. Do they need to... No. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> If you expected "true" PS2 BC, on PS4... well... you're an idiot. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Add/Alter/Emulate. Changes that, at least in theory, justify the need to rebuy games you owned as PS2 Classics on PS3. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Sony's PS2 to PS4 emulation is basically expanding on the same principle Nintendo used for why you had to rebuy Wii VC games on Wii U. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 You'll just sell X in a couple of weeks for more amiibo anyway. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @johnnydork 110% <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TELUSsupport, the TUP FAQ says I should have received an email w/instructions ~a wk before I was eligible, but I haven't received anything <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 way to sell a good handheld, for a mediocre game. Silly Nintendo fans. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @SonyXDevEurope Any word on these being available on the NA store any time soon? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Srsly tho... why is there so much salt thrown at Double Fine <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Opinions can be factually incorrect. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Basically everything tied to Transformers, since the end of Beast Machines and been trash anyway. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Why have they brought back Transformers and He-man multiple times, but not MASK or Silverhawks. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Why hasn't Hollywood rebooted the classic Duece Bigalow franchise. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> GI's review of X is more in line with what I've heard about the game. Captivating at first, but too long, and too grind-y. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ...I'm probably going to miss the PSX conference tomorrow. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 TLG might happen... W/date hopefully. FFVIIR... Is probably barely started <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 Nothing you'd really care about...
FFVII PC to PS4 port... some PS3/Vita localization/ports. Good games (indies) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> This is the sort of stuff that makes me want PSVR (100% Serious) https://t.co/o2VCH9nxPz <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 I hate bought the new 3DS, because I thought Xenoblade was a going to be a good game. Instead, I got a bad port of a meh game. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @glottis8 I found that Full Throttle and Grim didn't stand up to things like Monkey Island, or DoTT... but I'm old. :) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @glottis8 I don't think you can ever replicate the charm of those games... they're very special to a lot of people. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @glottis8 I loved Broken Age. I appreciated that it was a classic adventure game, w/o the issues that those games had (for the most part) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @glottis8 Really? Why is everyone so salty w/Double Fine? Is it just about Broken Age taking so long? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AltSeth Think Splatoon will be the last thing from Nintendo that I buy...It was the straw for me. Need to sell the stupid thing already. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 ...I've also bought all 4 iterations of the 3DS hardware. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 Minus amiibo, and I've probably spent more. Including VC, I have about 170 games between Wii U and 3DS. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @glottis8 I expected as much. They've been trying to get a pub for years... no one wants to fund those games. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The worst part is... I've probably spent more on 3DS games and HW than most of the so called Nintendo fans out there. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> 3DS being overrated, is one of the few things I'd agree with Colin from KindaFunny on. Vita's library, even though it overlaps, is better. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Some of the 3DS's best games don't work well on the HW. (looking at you Monster Hunter &amp; Kid Icarus) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> If you have the time/patience to search out quality, there's no way the 3DS library stands up vs iOS. I was a naysayer even 4 or 5mths ago. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The 3DS library, especially the first party one, as been remarkably weak over the last year or so. It's basically pushed me to mobile gaming <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The salt about 3DS getting snubbed at TGAs is pretty funny. Those mobile titles were better than anything on 3DS this year. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Souls III is a hard pass for me. 
I lack the time and patience for it now. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AltSeth Controls felt a bit floaty (on PC)...which made the trial and error more annoying, because it required a lot of precision later on <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheFrugster Or a middle aged French man that rivals Kojima when it comes to an inability to write dialog. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AltSeth Ori is super pretty, but the combat mechanics are real bad, and too much of the level design is based on trial &amp; error. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AltSeth Funny enough, but Ori isn't even an indie game... it was published by Microsoft Game Studios. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @tobias_0704 @NintendoTweet Only because they're trying to back fill their shell of a game. Splatoon was basically an Early Access game. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AltSeth It was against Axiom Verge, Her Story, Ori and Undertale. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> TBH, I thought Scott Weiland died years ago. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> None of this is as bad as Frozen winning best Animated Feature though... that was the absolute worst. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> And with that, I think I'm done with TGAs for this year. Come back next year, when I hate all the games that get awards again. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Sure as fuck didn't deserve best indie game though. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Sorry... I'm ok with Rocket League winning best Sports/Racing. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Yup... I looked at all the award winners from last night, and don't agree with a single award (But to be fair, I haven't played Her Story) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NintendoTweet lol 
Honestly, I don't think there was a single award I agreed with from last night. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ...here's hoping. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Curious if the UC4 trailer last night means they aren't showing any new footage at PSX <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Renton127 Well... it's censored because the game was basically pushing pedophilia in Japan... because it's culturally acceptable there. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NintendoTweet Yup. It beat good, complete games. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NintendoTweet One of the most incomplete games in recent memory won best Multiplayer... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Assuming the game actually releases, I'll buy it, but I'm not pledging $60USD just to play on a platform I don't hate. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm still a bit salty that the Psychonauts 2 Fig campaign makes the console ports an addon, and not just an option. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheGameFreakGuy It's the thing I didn't watch. No disrespect to Iwata, just think that stuff is kinda gross. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Like I said last night... PSX is my jam. Not because it's Sony focused, but because there should be some focus on the weird side of PS. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheGameFreakGuy Iwata thing isn't for me. I really dislike fake empathy towards the passing of someone you never actually knew. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Trying to catch up on some of the clips from TGAs last night... 
Real glad I didn't watch. Lotta "I don't really care" stuff. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Didn't catch that Shadow Complex Remaster was coming to PS4... 
Not that I'm going to re-purchase it anyway. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I guess we'll see how well I hold up, once things like E3 2016, and PSVR happen. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It's going to be strange, buying a more human number of vidya gaemz next year. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Justinator5000 People have a mountain of salt about the Broken Age kickstarter... and just a ton of hate for DF in general. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Cool. All the photos we had done of Shep are finished. They turned out well. Newborn photographers have a hard job... 4real. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Out of all the TGA stuff, the most disappointing announcement was the MKX Kombat Pack 2 Roster. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mp1990GAF 1 was a fair bit harder, so don't feel bad if you're getting REKT <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mp1990GAF 1 or 2? Bayo2 was super easy. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @JohnSantina FF9. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @JohnSantina yes. It's the 2nd best FF <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 fuck AAA <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 yeah... Splatoon shouldn't have won anything <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 gonna be a lot of good games (Indies), so most people won't actually like the show <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 but Nintendo didn't release anything worthwhile in 2015... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> +$18 for a console key on Psychonauts 2 killed any interest I had in backing it. Not intention of hooking my PC back up. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Oh yeah... This was a thing that happened https://t.co/rv9XAH5I5E <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @wlatham92 they do a good job of making an awful world interesting. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Just give me Witness, Firewatch, and the DotT remaster and I'm good for the year. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> My goal for 2016 is to buy no more than 10-12 AAA games. I probably bought 3 times that this year. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @wlatham92 they were mighty dank. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @wlatham92 I like Tales a little better. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @wlatham92 I really like Broken Age... It's the shit Schaffer hasn't been a part of that's been a mess. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @wlatham92 nah. Too much of the "hardcore" audience hate Bathesda... Even though they still buy the games (like Konami) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @wlatham92 I still need to play that sometime... Is it PC only? My box is unhooked. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @wlatham92 people love CDPR too much for Witcher not to win... Even if it was by far the worst of the nominees. That's life though. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> PSX is my show. Sony is gonna show some weird ass indie games that are actually fucking interesting, and twitters gonna bitch about them <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @wlatham92 no, because the community is trash. Imagine if Witcher, or Bloodborne didn't win GotY, and something interesting did. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheGameFreakGuy because you have awful taste in video games? At least a good mobile game won, rather than 3DS shovelware. :} <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @wlatham92 it's basically the MTV Vidya Gaemz Awards. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It be like saying Splatoon was the best multiplayer game this year... Oh... Wait... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Axiom Verge is the real game of the year, or at the very least the best indie game. Rocket League is fine, but super shallow. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Glad I didn't invest energy in watching the show and just bitched about the poor choices for winners on Twitter. I agreed w/0 of the awards. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> People were dickriding Witcher all year, so it's no surprise it won. As I said before, no AAA game deserved the award this year. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Gross <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 But there's no amiibo... So who cares <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 it doesn't run well on PS4... It'll be worse on Xbone <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 Batman &gt; TWD. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm not even watching TGAs...why am I awake...oh yeah...tiny human will need to be fed soon, and he'll wake me up anyway <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AltSeth don't hate the Charlie Brown Christmas album... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Flunkie does it have to be finished to qualify? Because they'll run out of funds before it's done at this rate, <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Honestly, Konami should have canned Kojima halfway through the MGSV dev cycle... When budget bloat and feature creep were obvious. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Send out all the edgy FuckKonami tweets you want... No one is going to read them. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Konami is a business. They literally don't give a fuck about what a bunch of nerds think of their low profit gaming division. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Batman Arkham Knight wins my Mario Sticker Star award, as the most disappointing release of the year. MKX was the runner up. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Witcher 3 wins my AC Black Flag award as the game everyone loves, that I hate passionately. Ori and the Blind Forest is the runner up. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm hoping this means that MGSV will win GotY. A) for the salt, and b) because fuck Witcher 3 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 did you not get it for free on the good console? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> GAF people are trolling the Iwata tribute? Ok.
I don't even care about his contributions to the industry...that's just kinda cuss <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It's not about Kiefer being bad (he was). It's about The Joker being one of the best voiced roles in video games. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Burn that building down if he beat Mark Hamill. Joker save AK from being a complete train wreck. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm not watching...but did Keifer win best VO? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch grats on the free 7yr old game. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Art Direction is the only thing Ori deserves credit for. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> CD Project Red wins dev of the year for releasing a poorly optimized game that wasn't as good as its predecessor. Yeah, fuck these awards. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Rocket League isn't even in my top 10 indies this year. Win based on hype. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Cool that the only fighting game with nonfunctional online play won...because people bought into the guest characters. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Far Cry 4 was trash. Primal can eat a bag o'dicks <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Day. Fucking. One. https://t.co/ENzbnrdxlc <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Hope Dorito Pope got a nice check from Nintendo for that trash <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Splatoon, one of the worst shooters ever made, won shooter of the year. gg <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GuerrillaDawg @omek90 offset sticks r 4dagayz <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The salt about this PS2 this is glorious <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GuerrillaDawg @omek90 I did the same thing. $7 sticks was cheaper than ordering caps for my sticks <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GuerrillaDawg Master Race will curse lord GabeN <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It's like BC on XB1. Most of you don't have the time for your new games...GTFO with saying you're going to play old shit. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> People being salty about the who-the-fuck-cares-really PS2 emulation. You'll never actually play that shit anyway. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch Battlefront is the casual friendly shooter. I've been enjoying it a fair bit, given my limited gaming time. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Renton127 keynote is Saturday sometime. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It's unlikely that I'll watch TGAs. Looking forward to PSX though. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Curious if this means Rising Thunder might come to PS4. https://t.co/QFaeXDVICK <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mp1990GAF I'm at 54. Git gud m8 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I keep wanting to buy ESO for PS4 for absolutely no reason <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @glottis8 His no-compete apparently ended in Dec (likely Dec 1st). The ink is probably just drying on whatever contract he signed. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @glottis8 It's Kojima. Of course he would. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Man... first day back to work has been rough... I'm tired AF. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Speaking of TGAs... when does the PSN sale go live? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Kojima is clearly announcing his new studio at TGAs. Clearly. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AltSeth Like almost every good series on the DS, in the transition to the 3DS. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Earned 1 PS4 trophy (1 bronze) in Just Cause 3 - https://t.co/p4uUPiZ39W <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AltSeth Yup. I'm legit surprised they didn't make one for 3DS... <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Wii U is getting one of the few good Wii games on the VC today. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @passthemstickss Game is beautiful artistically, in every way... It's just a sub par Metroidvania title mechanically. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @passthemstickss It's not really hard, it's just the level design punishes you from not know what's coming. A lot of repetition is required. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I don't understand the praise for Ori. Combat mechanics were awful, and so much of the game was designed on trial &amp; error. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> As far as public outcry? 
If you make something offensive, and expect not to get complaints... well... you're an idiot. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> LOLygon's review of Bayonetta 2 is a prime example of where my issues are. You don't dock movie/book reviews for being offensive, why games. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The "SJW r ruinin' vidya gaemz" stuff needs to go away. I have issues with some people being a bit over dramatic about things, but still... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mp1990GAF Internet was a mistake. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @wlatham92 No way it could possibly be that bad. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 @TheGameFreakGuy I'm only sort of joking. iOS has a lot of trash, but there's some really solid PC to iOS ports there. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheGameFreakGuy @Mattmanver2 Just get an iPhone. Eet haz better gaemz. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ...'cause Nintendo is insane if they continue down the path of making multiple devices, because they clearly can't support them. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Over/Under on the NX using Tablets/Smart Phones are a replacement for the Wii U GP, and allowing something similar to remote play on devices <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AltSeth So I've heard. I have no reasonable excuse for not seeing it yet. It just never happened. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> SFV, Mirror's Edge, Ratchet, Unravel, Uncharted 4, and The Division are all I have left. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Running low on pre-paid PS4 games. Gonna have to open the wallet soon :| <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 They're going to wait until the NX reveal. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I still haven't seen Fury Road yet. 
It's on my Xmas list....
Which I got complaints from fam about, because it's too short (apparently) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm back to work... so I can tweet about hating Nintendo and AAA gaemz again. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> And that's why my 8yr nephew is getting a PS4 for Xmas, instead of a Nintendo system (which I would have suggested even a few yrs ago) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I won't be buying Nintendo HW again, and I openly discourage friends and family from investing in their consoles. The support isn't there. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I've never seriously wished failure on a company, but after the Wii U, and 3DS, I wouldn't be unhappy if Nintendo "went away" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Exactly how bad is Beyond Two Souls? I "mostly" liked Heavy Rain at the time, I just don't think it aged well. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 https://t.co/vdyLfb3TlR <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @wlatham92 I'm actually pretty happy with my list this year, even if a couple of them aren't exactly new 2015 releases (Tearaway and Talos) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @JohnSantina Divinity Original Sin is the spiritual successor to that game. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Nice to see the early 2016 line up starting to come together. Amplitude, Witness, Shadow of the Beast... all games I'm looking forward to. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> DariusBurst being $60 is sort of lulz. SHMUPs are $10-20 games now. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Srsly people. Most of the MCU movies have been garbage. Entertaining garbage, but garbage none the less. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> People sure what to hate BvS.
These are the same people that dick-ride the mediocre Marvel CU films.... so who the fuck cares. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 I guess. Rev 2 is basically just a sub-par action game with some slight horror elements. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AltSeth Not sure tbh. Seems like they might be trying to pre-load too much of the game world at load. It's super painful. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 Probably not, unfortunately. Capcom "claimed" that RE Rev was going to be for OG RE fans (which it isn't really) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @johnnydork GOAT console right there... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Tbh, I'd take a load time patch for Just Cause 3 over FPS fixes. FPS issues on PS4 don't ruin the experience... 2min long load times do. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheFrugster Except Ubi, EA, and Activision...because Big AAA 3rd party r da worst #REALGAMERSDONTPLAYGAEMZTHEYBITCHABOUTTHEM NEOGAFdotCOM <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mp1990GAF Except Game and Wario. that game is pure trash. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheGameFreakGuy Honestly, even if the Syrian refugees weren't fleeing the terrorists, they'd still be less violent than Conservative Murica <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It still amuses me that a good number of America's think the solution to gun violence is more guns. Ignorance is bliss I guess. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Is the country refuses to do anything about guns, just wall them out of Canada and Mexico and arm all of them. 10yrs, they'll all be dead. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> At what point do we stop pretending that American's killing each other with guns is news. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Samurai Jack is one of the best cartoons ever made <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 Sure. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Earned 4 PS4 trophies (4 bronze) in 2 games - https://t.co/p4uUPiZ39W <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AltSeth I didn't beat either. Was about 40hrs in DA. 10, tops in Witcher. Like DA, but just not a fan of high fantasy writing anymore. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GuerrillaDawg man... I've played 5-10hrs of the game. I don't like it... Any of it. At all. Don't even know why I bought the DLC. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Deleted Witcher 3 from my PS4. Will do the same to Dragon Age. I'll never go back to them... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Oh... and that PS+ Gauntlet game isn't very good. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> High fantasy dialog makes me eye roll something fierce. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> yup. Still don't like Witcher 3. At all. Why the fuck did I buy the edition with the DLC again... :| Oh yeah... da hype. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AltSeth I like the new mode, and the pod one... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm more excited for Firewatch and The Witness than I am for a single AAA game in 2016... outside of maybe Mass Effect. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> My goal for next year is to cut down my AAA game purchases to an absolute minimum. Time is now a factor, as is money, and enjoyment. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> honestly, I wouldn't give a single AAA game a GotY award this year. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> New BF mode that comes with Battle of Jakku is actually kinda fun. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AltSeth Rayman Legends. All for $30. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> BTW... if you don't already own the games... I highly recommend the UbiArt bundle on the PSN. It's 3 of Ubi's best games. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I think I've beat 54 games this year... my current sheet only lists PS4 games... and I've beat 47 of those. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Cool. I beat Brothers. In a day. With a newborn. 
I liked the game. The newborn puked on me twice. 
It's been a good day. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Fixing a Windows XP machine for someone... this is my life. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch Taking shots at console graphics is sort of picking low hanging fruit... decent PC rig would cost 3x what my PS4 did... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch That doesn't make it good... or any better than The Order... (which really isn't that bad, just disappointing) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch To be fair, UT is only F2P because it's working as an advert for UE... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch dat console to PC port FTW. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 gross. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 Batman... he probably won something (as he should) for voicing the Joker <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @wlatham92 I felt like parts (the Joker) were really well done. Gotham was fine. The tank, and handling of open-world-i-ness, was kinda bad <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Strange that there's performance issues in the PS4 version of Brothers... then again, it's clearly a cash grab port post license change. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @JohnSantina Technically games take longer now... 2-3 year dev cycles are a minimum, with exponentially more people involved. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> As time has gone on, I feel like Arkham Knight is probably my biggest disappointment of the year. So much of that game was bad. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Cleared a couple hundred GBs of space on my PS4. Games I already beat, and won't go back to *cough* Batman *cough* <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm only about 30-40min into Brothers, and I already feel bad for waiting this long to play it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @JohnSantina Not really true. Some of the "greatest" games of our childhood took a couple of hours to beat...People just expect more now. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Finally playing Brothers. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 https://t.co/tm8sy79Qgs <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 https://t.co/sGH8qnRvLo <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> TFW you get random looks on the Linkedin profile you never update... https://t.co/2F5EF33OgZ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AltSeth Probably. I've seen some hardcore Inafune fans turn on that game though... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Game reminds me of Far Cry 4. But a more fun, because of the destruction. Story and characters are garbage though (like FC4 minus Min) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Just Cause 3 doesn't run that bad on PS4... Load times are absurd, but the FPS isn't fun-prohibiting. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Granabanana Story was fine in XBC... it was the combat, and the MMO-like questing that made it bad. X looks to focus more on the bad stuff <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Granabanana Chronicles is one of the worst JRPGs I've played... X looks worse. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> So yeah...those Just Cause 3 load times are pretty comical. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The Internet was a mistake. Enthusiast gaming sites and forums are a mistake. All of it is nothing but trash. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Srsly... There are better games coming to Xbone. Don't get excited about the ones that'll likely be mediocre. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Sort of like I don't understand why people are excited for ReCore. It's Inafune w/a below average studio... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Does anyone, anywhere, still give a fuck about Inafune and his bullshit Kickstarter projects? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Would buy again. https://t.co/nr3IXfbkY9 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> On top of being sort of expensive, formula feeding a newborn is a fuck ton of work. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AltSeth Axiom, Olliolli2, Hotline 2, Titan Souls... Just to name a few...I really enjoyed Rapture, although I know some didn't. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AltSeth I'm silently judging you... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AltSeth Tearaway, and Fallout 4 are the only "AAA" titles on my GotY list this year. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AltSeth It's why 7 of my top 10 games this year are technically indies... 8, if you include Tales from the Borderlands (which is indie) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AltSeth is it though? Witcher 3 was almost unplayable at launch... so was AC Unity... Batman was busted on PC. This is modern AAA dev. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch I actually like the Xb1 controller btw... I just think the shoulder buttons are poorly positioned, and awkward to use. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AltSeth really depends on the leak. I've seen app crashing leaks that are linked to a single line in the code. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch I've had 2 DS4s since launch... No issues outside of the sticks. Probably take care of my shit better than most though. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch you can't fix poor design/placement... I just replaced my ds4 sticks... Everything else is fine (except the battery life) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch outside of the sticks, the controller is fine. Neither new gen controller is great tbh...xb1 has shit shoulder buttons. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ...this is why more than half of my top 10 games this year are indie. Because they're good, they're at least a little unique, and they work. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Honestly, most of AAA, regardless of platform has either been a technical mess, or underwhelming. Why are people still surprised? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> So Just Cause 3 on console is mess... Like half the AAA games that have released this gen. It'll get patched soon enough... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Justinator5000 I got it on PS4. I suspect it'll get post launch patches like everything else... By that time, I might have the time to play <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @CodeRedShell its not out for a couple of months <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis hope ur not an Islamic Black Woman... Cause u fuck in 'Murica, if you are. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Earned 5 PS4 trophies (5 bronze) in 3 games - https://t.co/p4uUPiZ39W <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Although I agree with the complaint that the X UI is a mess that most MMO designers would be embarrassed of <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Internet is taking a Polygon review personally again. Just remember guys... if it's not Microsoft, it's not good. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 except everyone already has a phone... and most people play handheld games on the shitty nowadays... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @passthemstickss @wlatham92 nope. Nintendo owns them. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Ori and the Blind Forest got 9s too... and that game is real bad. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I mean... people gave Xenoblade Chronicles a 9... and that game was kinda bad. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Xenoblade X reviews just tell me it's a nintendo 1st party game, and all the reviews are throw away. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch I just legit don't care. 60fps doesn't improve anything for me. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @nsuttner: HEY! Don't forget: N++ and Axiom Verge are both 30% off on PS4 right now ($13.99), and you'll save another 10% with this code… <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Justinator5000 I'm playing Max now... It's one of the more polished next gen games I've played tbh... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Earned 2 PS4 trophies (2 bronze) in Mad Max - https://t.co/p4uUPiZ39W <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch I started at launch, but the PS4 version was trash. One day I'll go back. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch As soon as I get of track, the game completely falls apart for me. It's why RPGs shouldn't be open world... ever. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch The map is full of random garbage to do... and none of it's very much fun. I might try again and just power through the story <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch 3 was less engaging than what I played of 2. Narrative was deluted by the open world collectathon bs. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch meh. Combat in TW3 was bland, and a lot of the systems were convoluted. Also, the console port was embarrassing. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Flunkie Play it on Wii. The 3DS port is real bad. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I need to move where my PS4 is. I can't play in my office chair when a tiny human refuses to sleep anywhere but on my chest. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Maybe the AI was better on Wii...but XC3D's AI was intolerable bad. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Dear JRPG devs... Never make a combat system that givesyou partial party control, and then makes combat reliant on positioning and combos. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The misguided hype train for Xenoblade Chronicles X doesn't help much either. Still bitter I spent $300 to play the original, and it was bad <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Nothing makes me want to bitch about vidya gaemz like Witcher 3 GotY noms...or half baked "Wii U sold well" back pats <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm hopefully about a week away from getting my new phone. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis bro... Game iz GoaT. Assuming ur ok with piss poor combat, clunky systems, and shit FPS. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis is the Wii U just 2 Wiis taped together... That's what the interwebz told me. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I still can't, in good conscience, recommend a Wii U to any friends or family this holiday. You'd be buying into a dead console. Sorta sad. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis basically a B tier retailer sold a bunch of a C tier console <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis the Wii U bundle was apparently in Target's top 3 selling items online... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis meanwhile a last gen console was one of Targets top selling units in the US... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Justinator5000 I'm just looking for a game that's dumb fun right now... don't have time for much else. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GuerrillaDawg @ETDragonPunch WoW is simplified to a point of being boring. They used Mage as the base for all class complexity <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GuerrillaDawg @ETDragonPunch I quit raiding in WotLK. I was talking more about general difficulty... like rotations, itemization <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Justinator5000 GAF gonna have a field day if the PS4 version performs better... Unfortunately. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch nah... lack of difficulty, and class identity are the bigger issues. Content is an issue, but not why you shouldn't play WoW <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AltSeth I don't feel like it's good... but it doesn't feel worse than something like Mordor... which was a subpar game w/a gimmick. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I can't tell if I'm actually enjoying Mad Max as a game, or just the fact I can accomplish something in a 10-15min play session. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheSharkSurname just the Jack the Ripper stuff AFAIK. Pass was pretty poorly detailed. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 @ItsameDennis also... Fite me <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 @ItsameDennis MC Story mode is at worst mediocre...SS is on par with Superman 64 and Bubsy 3D. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 @ItsameDennis you liked Sticker Star... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Justinator5000 did it patch? Read that Day 1 was rolling out today... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 but it's super weeb...doesnt that cancel out shitty combat? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 how do you, of all people, not like that game? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Justinator5000 My copy hasn't even preloaded yet... :( <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Earned 4 PS4 trophies (4 bronze) in Mad Max - https://t.co/p4uUPiZ39W <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Just Cause 3 sounds like just the right amount of fucking stupid. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis I know. People are shit. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I could, in theory, go to bed for an hour or so before I have to wake up to feed the baby... But that seems silly <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I don't regret BLOPS3 because it's bad, I regret it because the progression system doesn't work for me given I don't have the time to play. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @wlatham92 I boot it up, play a couple rounds... Then play something else. I don't feel punish for doing that like with CoD or normal BF <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @wlatham92 yeah, but if you're not a nerd that only plays a single game all the time like the CoD heads...it doesn't get stale. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> As shallow as Battlefront is... It's actually fairly compelling, since it's fun. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Played a little Mad Max and a couple rounds of Battlefront while the baby's asleep. Sort of regret buying BLOPS3 now... 4srs <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Justinator5000 nope. Straight co-op mission play. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @wlatham92 it's basically a MMO with no human interaction... No clue what the draw of the game other than the mechs is. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @wlatham92 given how little I liked the first, Nintendo couldn't pay me to be excited for it. Combat looks super dull again. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 yay. Most certainly yay. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It's amazing how much harder it is to hate vidya gaemz when you have a fraction of the time to play them. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> My current GotY. Buy it if you don't already own it. https://t.co/PS4SVKmMrJ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Mad Max is pretty ok. It's just as repetitive, and poorly written as Mordor, but just "not AC" enough to feel better. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @CodeRedShell 8. He has 0 interest in Nintendo stuff... Their franchises mean less than nothing to him or his friends. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> FYI - Niche-y mid-tier JRPGs aren't a selling point for an 8 year old. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Wii U is legitimately dead. There's no important releases coming to that hardware now. Zelda is not a Wii U title. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Well... my nephew is getting a PS4 for xmas. Was asked if they should have bought him a Wii U instead. I lol'ed and said it's ded. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Controls in Mad Max are a bit jank-y... but not terrible. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Took 40mins to get the dls to start... but I finally got my purchased games to dl. #BasedPSN <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> $64 for 2 games isn't a bad deal. There was other stuff I wanted, but honestly, this was more than I should have bought anyway. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Bought Dishonored and Mad Max on sale w/the coupon <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AltSeth pls figure out a second book to cover bottle feeding... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NintendoTweet people are depressing <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The local @Telus retail stores are either young and lazy, or old and uninformed. Guess I'll have to call customer service. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> :| @Telus apparently won't let me TUp a few days early to get the Black Friday sale on the 6P. Store wouldn't even call and try. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Earned 2 PS4 trophies (2 bronze) in Penarium - https://t.co/p4uUPiZ39W <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Renton127 Are you serious? That's kind of the worst possible reason to boycott a game. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @HBrawler both of whom would have been better than most of the other trash they filled Super Smash with... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ME Andromeda is literally the only game I've been super "hype" for in a few years. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @arrayoob guess so... It's a web app that generates the list. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis ...why don't the "Mom's basement" dwelling weirdos just save their money and stream porn. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Man... DOAX is pretty gross. It's as bad, if not worse, than half the Vita library. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Play-asia's social media account is apparently run by someone with the intellect and maturity of a 4th grader. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @passthemstickss I unfortunately did... just to play that game (because my Wii was dead) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @passthemstickss As in the Wii/3DS game, or X? If you're talking the original... just don't play on 3DS. Port is really bad. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis hunting was one of the few things I enjoyed in 4. You didn't have to deal with the poor encounter design from missions <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @passthemstickss Have you played it? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @passthemstickss (and the story is poorly paced because of the empty MMO-like quest system) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @passthemstickss Chronicles is one of the worst JRPGs I've ever played. Almost everything outside of the story is complete garbage. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I can only assume that most of the people excited for Xenoblade Chronicles X didn't play the original. OR have shit taste. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 But unplayable... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ...so... this is what showed up as my top 25 https://t.co/G58u2n8Jph <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ...I'm sorta with people on the King's Quest thing... I mean the ep is long-ish... but just the single ep seems sort of silly. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis wut script... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis R&amp;C3 over Crack in Time. Dennis... ur high AF <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 lol thanks. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Baby...literally every time I tried to put him down last night https://t.co/F6bInFdznW <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> If people wanted Knack that badly, they could have saved a dollar or two every month since launch and just bought the fucking game... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Guess we'll find out about the Dec PS+ titles in the next couple days... Can't wait for the comment sections... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> As a reminder; if you don't like Tearaway, you're a soulless goblin. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @mediamolecule: Congratulations @PlayStation! Over 30 million PS4's sold since launch, hooray! Time for a papery party to celebrate! htt… <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 DOAX1 was easily one of the best Volleyball games ever made... It's a shame the franchise went to shit tbh. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 I've played all the mainline DoA games. There was a time where they were good... that time has passed... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 sooooo.... DOAX was a solid volleyball game. The sequel and 3, are fap bait bullshit, and nothing more. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Which is better? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> So... The Divinity port on PS4 is pretty solid. Like Wasteland, they've done a good job of mapping the controls to a controller. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch grats <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheGameFreakGuy at least 42% of your followers have awful taste confirmed. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> "Hey guiz, im kool. like me pls." 
"Look we haz Steam salez"
"Look at dees kool modz" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> PC Gamers trying to be hip again. They're like that weird uncle that always tries to be cooler than he is... https://t.co/rvAAqcsKGo <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> So Battlefront didn't sell well at retail apparently... You know...  Without and legit information to back up the "core" shit posting... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NintendoTweet nah. heavy rain was OK. I'm probably going to get Detroit. I had Divinity on PC... But I've retired from the master race. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I was going to buy Beyond Two Souls... But I bought a good game instead... (Divinity) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'd put Battlefront on my GotY list over Bloodborne. Fite Me. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> My K/D in Battlefront is sitting at 1.2 or so... I've never been that good at a FPS before. I legit love the game. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> My tweets have now become 90% "new parent" tomfoolery, and 10% "Nintendo sux" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Got about $150-$200 worth of high grade bottles for $35... They're used, but you sterilize that shit anyway. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> 3rd in Walker Assault... and a win as Rebels. At literally the last second too. Score. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NintendoTweet Nah... every night I tell him stories of the glory days of the GCN... and how Nintendo iz shit now. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> My proudest moment will be the day when Shep looks at me and says "Dad... Sticker Star was trash". I'll probably cry. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis bro... He's a week old... He's already too mature for that Nintendoyearold trash. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The lost sleep and added expense of having a baby is no where near as hard as the 8yr and 10s of thousands we spent to get here. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Real life over share tweet coming up. pls 2 b excite <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Dealing with a wide awake, week old newborn, at 3am is the Dark Souls of life. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Stealth___ "best" is very much subjective. A lot of movie and music awards are handled the same way though. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The 1st DOAX was a legit good game tbh though. 2 was fap-bait like 3 appears to be. If you want it, both you and your taste in game are shit <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> People are upset that DOAX3 isn't coming to the west, because most of us aren't weird perverts and think the game is gross. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ...except Nintendo games. That company still doesn't speak to me in the slightest anymore. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I already find that it's a lot easier to be positive, and enjoy games when you have less time to play them... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Wife is starting to recover, so I got some rounds of Walker Assault in. Emperor is GOAT. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> https://t.co/SqvTvvoQPx
Calling a member of Breaking Benjamin a singer is a bit of a stretch. Shit band, w/shit taste. Cool Story bro. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @johnnydork So it plays at 10FPS... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 because people are awful <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> no matter how much you want to criticize Battlefront, there's nothing in gaming more satisfying that killin' a bunch of fools as Vader. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AltSeth iknorite. They want me to have a call with management about the role... While I'm off lol <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Job description is super vague...but if it pays more... Who dafuq cares. Need dat $$ for games and formula. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Joesff its fun. It's even more fun if you like Star Wars. And even more if you're not a hardcore CoD player <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm on holidays... And I got an email from work about a job offer. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Quality newborn photographers are basically wizards. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Oh hai <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 yup. I have a 250mbps connection... Annoys me when people have crap connections. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AltSeth probably. I showed him the game... He was inconsolable. Then he pooped. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Justinator5000 lol obviously. I was just reading random wiki posts at 3am this morning and found it out. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Son's bday is shared with Miyamoto... Kinda cool, I guess. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I've gone from a chronic gaming shit poster, to an annoying yuppie posting about my newborn. #nofucksgiven <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis slowly. It's gonna be a while...but I'll live. I have Candy Crush on my iPad now... Better than the entire 3DS Library. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Babies are like drunks; they don't say anything that makes sense...They piss and shit themselves...And they pass out mid drink half the time <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Shit guiz... I got to play a round and a half of Battlefront while the baby slept. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis @GuerrillaDawg fuckin rigged polls man... MemeKing isn't a democracy. Dennis is da MemeKing 4lyfe <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Earned 1 PS4 trophy (1 bronze) in STAR WARS Battlefront
 - https://t.co/p4uUPiZ39W <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @wlatham92 had the same clipping bug. I loled <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @bfletchtone I still haven't gone to Diamond City. Was level 22 I think... The last I played. It's already my GotY though. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> #newgamerdad the struggle is real <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I have Witcher plus DLC, BB plus DLC, Fallout 4 plus DLC, and both CoD and Battlefront w/Season Passes. Should be set for a while. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> As it turns out...obsessive preordering will probably save my hobby. Shepard is officially now a formula baby...So whole new levels of broke <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I bought Battlefront, Fallout and Just Cause 3 knowing I might not have time to play them for days/weeks/months. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'd really like to play some more Battlefront. I loved the few rounds I've got to play so far... But newborn and wife come first. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 I had the better systems of that gen... Xbox and Gamecube. Didn't need any of that Sony Pony BS. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I've been stuck playing games on my iPad during periods where I couldn't sleep... only thing worse would be playing 3DS...or Wii U. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NintendoTweet lol iPad during sleepless nights... that's about all. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Just sort of generically referring to him as a baby.
I need to get back to the important things in life... like mocking weebs <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Nothing life threatening for wife or baby thankfully... just draining in every possible fuckin' way. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Everything was pretty smooth with the baby, after a rocky L&amp;D, but then things went a bit south. We appeared to have turned a corner though. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Forgot I pre-paid for Old Hunters, even though I'm not where near done the main game... and have 0 time to play games right now. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @bfletchtone thx a lot. :) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm legit excited for PS2 emulation on PS4, because I've only ever played a couple PS2 titles. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Pretty easy to make a huge open world game when 90% of your character model assets look like they're from the PS2. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Man... Xenoblade Chronicles is one of the worst JPGs I've played. X will be as bad or worse from what I've seen. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis His name is Shepard. I sort of expected you to make fun of it lol <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Nope. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @PranooYY Well... games journalism isn't actual journalism. It's media... so yeah... it's just there for PR purpose and hype cycles. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis baby's been pretty good so far...considering he's not even 3 full days old. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @PranooYY Not really. There's an expectation for professional sites to write professional pieces. Kotaku is being treated like a std Blog. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> This baby thing isn't half bad. Try to keep baby occupied to let mom sleep... and then I take naps during feeds. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @PranooYY If you're trying to fraud like you're a professional site, you should probably write like one. That's why I'm ok with it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @PranooYY Kotaku writes a lot of slander pieces for the sake of clicks. Most of which read like a teenager on tumblr wrote them... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis especially when 99% of the people writing about games now are just tumblr rejects. The days of actual journalists is gone. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Kotaku's QQ post would be more valid if 99% of their posts were complete and utter trash. GG Gawker Media <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @PranooYY I support it. It's the pubs choice to blacklist a site that write about trash 95% of the time. Wish more pubs would do it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis for ever decent piece Schreier does, he writes 15 shitty clickbait-y pieces that sound like their written by some fanboy teen <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Managed to squeeze in a round of Battlefront, and a quick try on Super Star Wars during breakfast while my mother-in-law was over lol <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis thx man. It's been a super long few days... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Battlefront got the scores I expected it to. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Night 2 at the hospital. Hopefully only one more night, and we can all go home.
At least I got a few good days with Fallout 4 lol <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NintendoTweet his bday is the 16th here. He's almost a whole day old lol <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheFrugster yeah. The process of the baby getting out didn't go well, but everyone is fine now. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Thx to everyone for the well wishes. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> So yes... His name is now 100% a Mass Effect reference. Plan is to make him a N7 onesie for his first Halloween <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Btw, baby is a boy... And his name is Shepard. Wife picked the name, I tweaked the spelling. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Renton127 thanks :) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Justinator5000 thanks :) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @passthemstickss thanks :) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> After about 15hrs, a bit of a clusterfuck, and a lot of stressful stuff...the baby has finally arrived. On his due date, no less. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Earned 1 PS4 trophy (1 bronze) in Gems of War - https://t.co/p4uUPiZ39W <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @browland1 same. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheSharkSurname PC in Spring, PS4 in Q4 I think <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Got an hour and change of sleep...been sitting in the hospital for 10hrs... Gud timez. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Man... Raps are such a bad shooting team... Either DeRozan or Lowry need to go. Your 2 main scorers can't be shooting 30% from the floor. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GuerrillaDawg I've had no issues. Digital master race <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 My character is pretty terrible at VATs, because his Perc is low... I end up just sniping fools. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 @SpinelessOyster Both will buy it at the same time. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ... I beat Room 3 on iPad. Easily better than anything I played on 3DS or Vita (prior to selling it) this year. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> How about no religion in video games... ok... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ...https://t.co/JeEk5ySDZJ
Well... so much for buying Rise of the Tomb Raider next year. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AW_141 Given how awful DICE's campaigns are, I'm sort of glad they aren't doing one for Battlefront. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AW_141 It's Battlefield with a Star Wars skin. Little less punishing to those that don't play all the time, but that's about it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AW_141 there isn't a lot of variety... just a lot of attention to detail to what is there. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AW_141 Battlefront isn't really for the "core" gamer... it's for casual shooter fans, and SW nerds. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AW_141 The 19 weapons thing is a moot point as well. CoD and Battlefield have 50+, with a handful of usable ones (4-6) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AW_141 All the pass adds is more maps/heroes/weapons. It's on par with any other pass tbh... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AW_141 Not really. That's like saying you have to buy the pass for CoD... or Battlefield... or Batman... or literally any AAA game. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Can sort of see why it's not well reviewed on mobile... 'cause it's not very good compared to like games. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Gems of War is sort of a shitty F2P version of Puzzle Quest, with almost all the polish removed. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Earned 3 PS4 trophies (1 bronze and 2 silver) in Fallout 4 - https://t.co/p4uUPiZ39W <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> As much as people have shit talked it, I'm still really looking forward to Battlefront <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Money Trees is still one of my favorite tracks. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis outside of being a Xbox fan... :} <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 not in TR2013. Narrative was universally considered pretty bad. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 pure mechanics... Sure. Narrative. Not a chance. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch not sure I agree with that. Better narrative... Everything else was on par or worse IMO <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch Obsidian, the only dev capable of making a game more buggy than Bethesda. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> But to be fair, I almost always been Ubi games, and I almost never beat Bethesda games. Ubi's side content is so bad, I just power through. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> That's the Ubi issue. Far Cry. AC. Whatever. It's all repetition of the same 2 or 3 basic OBJs... replicated 100s of times on the map. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Bethesda is exceptional at creating worlds that you feel compelled to explore. Probably because they don't litter the map with std OBJs. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Lvl 21 now... still haven't gone to Diamond City... Probably never will at this rate. So many side quests, and random shit to investigate. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Man... some of the stuff in Fallout is real shoot-y. And my character is built in a way where I'm worse off using VATs :| <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Yeah... that's 100% not accurate https://t.co/JaYweoDgum <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ...ugh... why do I read comments sections on N4G posts... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Cryolator mutha fuckas <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Almost everything I'm doing in Fallout seems like a really bad idea... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> One day I'll actually go to Diamond City... and do the 3rd story mission. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 nope. Pubs just don't release many anymore. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Flunkie my copy is preloaded on PS4... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Regardless of the wins it costs me... I can't bring myself to play aggro decks in Hearthstone. I'd rather just lose. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> TFW ur opponent in HS gets cocky, and it costs them the match <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheFrugster Well... a lot of the pre-review coverage is already shitting on the game... so I doubt it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Battlefront will likely end up sitting at about a 7 or so once reviews hit. Sounds like the SP stuff is light, and some modes feel bad. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Guess that EA/DICE put out some actual details for Battlefront's Season Pass. Pretty much what I expected. Modes/Maps/Weapons/Heroes/Planets <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> As it turns out, her water didn't break... the baby is just a jerk. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Wife didn't have the baby last night... but we did spend 3.5 hrs in the hospital... and have to go back on Sunday. So that's fun. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Anyway... moving along... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 Probably for the best. What ever you said would have been historically, and factually incorrect anyway. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Religion has been used, since inception, as a method of controlling and manipulating people. Not all followers... but enough. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The followers of Christianity are responsible for countless massacres over the the course of millennia...so, pot calling the kettle black <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Odd reading things like "These attacks are why we need to get rid of islam"... and I'm curious if anyone actually reads world history. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Lot of ignorant racist bullshit on the internet tonight. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Dear Conservative 'Murica... how about you don't blame all Muslims for the actions done by a select few. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Gone for a few hours.. come back to see that Conservative 'Murica has gone full retard... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @amiibonick yeah. but I buy digital, and PSN doesn't charge tax... so it's $80 flat, vs ~$58-$70 after tax for 3DS games. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @amiibonick CAD/USD exchange. Atlus games are $60 here on 3DS now... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> People sure are getting bitch-y about no PSN name changes again... cool story. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GuerrillaDawg boy <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GuerrillaDawg lol She called me on her way...She's in denial. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Wife thinks her water might have broke... so she goes to Costco. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Well...that's no happening. Keep forgetting that Big N is charging $50+tax for 3DS games now. I'll just play the shit I already have. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Earned 6 PS4 trophies (5 bronze and 1 silver) in Fallout 4 - https://t.co/p4uUPiZ39W <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Wife isn't going to let me sell it...so I might as well start using it (I guess). Plus...it'll come in handy when the wife goes into labour. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I might actually buy a 3DS game <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 @TheGameFreakGuy I really hate auto-combat, and the AI was real bad. Time to Kill was also way too long on trash fights... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Renton127 Nope... and it's not an indie game. MS published the game. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheGameFreakGuy @Mattmanver2 I don't think it was overwhelming. Combat was just complete unenjoyable. Terrible questing system too. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Also... Xenoblade on 3DS was a really, really bad game. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Not a fan of JRPGs anymore to begin with, but the whole JRPGs built around shitty MMO-like quest systems go away. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> NoA doin' their best to remove all the shady Japanese culture stuff from Xenoblade. Game still isn't going to be good, but it's nice to see. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @passthemstickss Xenoblade X by the sounds of it... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> :| fuckin' Hearthstone. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @wlatham92 After Sticker Star, and the last M&amp;L... not sure there's any hope. :| <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @wlatham92 yeah. Mechanically, the game fixes the issues that Advanced Warfare has... and admittedly wholesale rips off Titanfalls movement. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @wlatham92 Fair enough. I'm genuinely enjoying BLOPSIII. Probably the most enjoyment i've got out of a CoD title since BLOPs (or maybe 2) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @wlatham92 it's actually not too meme heavy. Writing is actually really good... especially compared to the terrible GoT series. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ...and I unfortunately know enough about eSports (or some of it) to vote for those 2 awards... not sure I can bring myself to do it though <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Trending Gamer is a category that can die in a fire... along with most of the nominees. :| <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheGameFreakGuy there are games with significantly better soundtracks, not on that list. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Tales from the Memelands is best narrative. LiS was good, but a bit to TUMBLR DOT COM for my tastes. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> None of the soundtracks up for awards are particularly good. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> BLOPSIII is probably the best shooter this year...Syndicate is the best action/adventure game I played...Rocket League is best sports/racing <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Last Guardian isn't actually my most anticipated game for next year... but it was the closest to it on that list. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @passthemstickss I don't really think any of the AAA games this year were all that memorable. I guess people expected more from MGS though. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Guilty Gear Xrd –SIGN– should win Best Fighting Game @thegameawards on December 3rd https://t.co/KQVdLYYNLz <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The Last Guardian should win Most Anticipated Game @thegameawards on December 3rd #TGALastGuardian <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Hearthstone should win eSports Game of the Year @thegameawards on December 3rd #TGAHearthstone <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Axiom Verge should win Best Independent Game @thegameawards on December 3rd https://t.co/KQVdLYYNLz <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Fallout 4 should win Game Of The Year @thegameawards on December 3rd https://t.co/KQVdLYYNLz <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Axiom Verge is a better game. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis nah <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Some of these nominations are dumb. Why is Witcher 3 up for best Art direction. It's generic fantasy. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ...MKX, which straight up doesn't work online, will probably win Fighting game of the year. Skullgirls Second Encore should be there... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 Downwell is the best handheld game of the year. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Hamill wins best performance. Joker was about the only thing that saved AK from being a complete trainwreck. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> If Ori wins best Indie game... I'll riot. Game was published by Microsoft... and it's not a very good game. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Out of the TGA noms... Fallout wins my GotY. Bloodborne is a not all that close second. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis lol I've tried to optimize Linux to play games... shit don't work. Lord GabeN is an idiot... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis It's based on Ubunutu... not sure WTF people expected <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Real sad that a SNES game will be emulated on a Sony console, before it makes it to the Virtual Console. Gud work Nintendo. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> For those that care... PSN blog seemed to confirm on their podcast that Super Star Wars will be available on the PSN this Tuesday. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Sorry.. there's 2 DQ games I care about... Heroes, and Builders. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Cracked my PS Gold Headset... Still works, but the one side sort of falls apart if I move it too much :| <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Was expecting Fallout 4 to be big. Was not expecting those numbers... not this fast, on so few platforms. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 The thirst for a Minecraft clone is real. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Small chance I'll still buy Persona 5. Real small. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Full-on JRPGs, and Blouse-y Fantasy WRPGs are off my buy list. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The only DQ game I care about right now, is a localization of DQ Builders. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @wlatham92 I turned it down to easy because I was fighting a "Giant Enemy Crab"... and I got tired of dying. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @wlatham92 I know people that bought AC Unity physical that had significantly more issues than me. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @wlatham92 I was curious, because I haven't had a single crash yet... and my FPS seems mostly ok. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @wlatham92 Did you buy physical? Just curious for non-scientific research I'm doing. And yeah... dying a lot. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Renton127 The Room 3. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> My biggest piece of advise for Fallout 4 is to quick save after almost everything you do. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GuerrillaDawg @Alcoholikaust Yeah. You don't so much play... as much as you... experience. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GuerrillaDawg @Alcoholikaust Game is literal cocaine for cat people... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ...because the iPad game I was going to play, was better than anything I have on my Wii U :} <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Real Talk; I turned off my Wii U to play a game on my iPad... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It's kind of sad that in Canada, digitally, Wii U games cost more than PS4 games. All of them. Kinda gross. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Turned on the Wii U for the first time in a few weeks to look at the eShop. It's half 1st party, and half failed Steam Green Light games. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 Yoshi is just the new Kirby. "Babies first platformer" essentially... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 Probably not. Most 1st party Nintendo games get a pt or 2 more than they deserve. Game looked pretty, but boring. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheFrugster Gamingbolt? Fuck no. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheFrugster Never trust Gamingbolt. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 The power of amiibo to sell subpar games... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Dreamscythe no, but I'm not sure anything beats what you fight at the Palace. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Dreamscythe Pro tip... Stay away from "The Palace" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> :| Alpha Deathclaw. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis No. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Renton127 not f2p.... It's a $60 retail game <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheGameFreakGuy Wasn't great for 3DS either. Remakes and old localizations for the most part. Hard to be excited about that. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Had to double-check, and Nintendo is still committed to the $75+tax CAD price on Wii U games, so I'm committed to not buying them. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Tomorrow is my last day of work before vacation. Well...sort of vacation. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ...Kamikaze Super Mutants. :| <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch true story. I still think PS3s exclusives are better than what XB1 has been getting. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Sony's exclusives were better, and more varied... something they haven't really followed up with this gen... but it doesn't matter anyway. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Man difference between PS4/XB1 gen and PS360 gen, is that exclusives seem to be selling systems for MS, where they didn't for Sony. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 You know how much I love amiibo. tbh... the Wolf Link one is the first one I've seen that doesn't look like hot trash. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 STD &amp; Terminal illnesses &gt; amiibo <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NintendoTweet lol ummm no. I actually don't really like Dragon Quest that much. At least not the proper series. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 I haven't bought anything in 5mths, and I still spent more than the average so called "fan"... lol <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> All the side quests in Fallout are trying to take me closer to Diamond City... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis And Ubisoft's billion seller franchise... Anno. (I actually like Anno... but still) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NintendoTweet I was here (unfortunately). Trying to figure out why Nintendo fans are excited about rereleases and real old localizations. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis But Dennis... what about all the EA gems... like Day-Z... and Day-Z Clone 1 through 5127. oooohhhh and Dino Minecraft <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Shame I don't follow more Sony Ponies. I'd like to see the salt about the NPD numbers. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Good. Needed to check. Was afraid I'd have to hear you brag about all the games you don't play on Steam soon... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Don't be a PCfat... all their good games are on/coming to PS4 anyway. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> MS threw everything at Oct, and managed to win NPD. Need to carry it forward into Nov &amp; Dec, or it's pretty meaningless though. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> My legit warning for people about Hyrule 3DS is that Omega Force had a hard time getting Musou to not be shit on Vita... imagine on 3DS... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis *Zelda NX. 0% Chance they're showing the Wii U version (if it still exists) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> :| That was a pain... Forgot how to unlink my FB facebook pic for my PSN account. Dem premium avatars... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Flunkie There's crazy people I work with, that are up 'til 1 in the morning doing shit. I can't be bothered. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Flunkie Oh... I'm on Salary. Still no way I'm working more than the hours I get paid for. They can eat a bag o'dicks. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Flunkie how the fuck does that work? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Seriously though... I need to stop being lazy, and just get rid of my 3DS. Not like any games I want will ever release on it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Nintendo fans: "That direct was amazing"
Almost everyone else: "WTF is a Direct" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 ...it was... 15yrs ago. It's basically the worst now. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm almost level 15. Still just fucking around w/side content. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Maybe I can find someone on Kijiji that will trade me a Vita for my *new* 3DS... :} <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 ...but you like Pokemon... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 ummm wut. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Anywho... back to Fallout 4. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I said I wasn't going to pay attention to the Direct... but Twitter flood over shrug-worthy announcements made it unavoidable. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch That's one more year than the Wii U... or the Wii. lol <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> 3DS is an underwhelming console that is getting a much of remakes and spin offs to fill up it's last year or so. Cool story. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Cloud is cool, but I can't justify buying more DLC for a game I don't like, on a system I don't play. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch May have? If they didn't... man... MS better be shittin' their drawers. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Fun fact: I actually like TP. More than either N64 Zelda or Skyward. 0 chance I'm buying a remake. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> No. https://t.co/0IRabckRRz <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I just realized that Fallout 4 has a giant enemy crab. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheGameFreakGuy couldn't possibly be less hyped. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NintendoTweet wut lol <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> This is the "lol" MS tweet btw. Probably don't list your employer if you're going to tweet fanboy nonsense. https://t.co/UADC1FqJAj <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> LOL at a MS employee acting like more than 5% of the XB1 owners will ever use Backward Compatibility. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Discover mechanic is decent. Will probably use the Jewel Scarab in place of Spiders in my Hunter deck. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Finished wing 1, and the class challenges for the new HS expansion. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Don't worry... they'll be sure to take points off the review score for things like "Sony cross-promotion", and "Not a MS exclusive" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> LOLygon trying to make themselves look like the good guys by boycotting the Battlefront review event. Cool story bro. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Earned 8 PS4 trophies (8 bronze) in 2 games - https://t.co/p4uUPiZ39W <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @JohnSantina Well...most of the Steam Machines aren't very good, and are overpriced. Makes more sense just to custom build. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I mean... lets be serious... Minecraft would be the best looking game on the 3DS... :} <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> In before the Minecraft announcement is actually for 3DS, because Microsoft doesn't even know WTF the Wii U is... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Nintendoyearolds are the target age (or maturity) demographic for Minecraft :} <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 DQLOCALIZATIONLOLIMJOKINGITSNEVERGONNAHAPPENSORRYNOTSORRY <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 I'll just play Fallout. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> TBH, none of the 3rd party characters should have ever been added. Not when Nintendo has their own characters relegated to trophies. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> BTW... There's no world where Shovel Knight should be in Smash. Not when Nintendo gave BS reasons to not include their own characters. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> People will either be excited about non-announcements (like DLC), or livid about their mismanaged expectations. So, yeah... fuck it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Direct Cycle has become too much to deal with. Rather just not even read about it... especially when I won't be giving Nintendo another dime <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NintendoTweet Thx. Don't really feel like reading all the misplaced excitement that follows a direct. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> When's the direct? I'd like to know when it stay off Twitter so I don't have to hear about it? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> As I predicted months before it's release, Fallout 4 will easily be my "Game of the year"... because indies aren't games to this community. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> :| Well... that sucked. Didn't quick save before fighting a giant crab thing, and lost some progress in Fallout. Oh well. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch I got both of the OG games for free through different GOG promotions. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 I'll live. There's absolutely no way I'd have the time to play it now anyway... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheGameFreakGuy I don't really trust Nintendo as a company. Been burned on the last 3 consoles (2 home, 1 handheld). <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis he just dug it up underneath some pipes... looked all pleased with himself afterwards. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> F-Zero GX is probably my favorite GCN game. The Nintendo dev'ed iterations aren't anywhere near as good. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Thinking about it... I'm not even sure a new F-Zero could get me to buy the NX. I don't trust Nintendo to not mess it up. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Anyway... after killing 6 Super Mutants in Fallout... I died to a fucking dog. It was an elite, flaming dog... but still. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Core issue with Pokemon, is rather then fixing the dull combat, they just add more poorly designed pokemon and pokemon types. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Reminder that Pokemon is by far Nintendo's least interesting franchise. It's basically a JRPG - narrative + obtuse Rock/Paper/Scissors <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheGameFreakGuy How about Nintendo announce games from franchises that aren't stale trash :} <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> "Dog found something"
Something... is a rocket launcher. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch Wildstar has been a story of good ideas with real poor implementation. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch true story. I tried. Lag boss was rough... Sort of how that game has played out though... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch didn't take long. Sort of surprised NCSoft didn't just kill it... they kill Tabula Rasa for a lot less. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Almost lvl 11. Still haven't gone to Diamond City... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 nope. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis sux man. All I've had is a teleporting cow, and a couple floating heads after crit kills. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis I guess I've been lucky... All the jank I've seen has been funny AF <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Wasn't incredibly clear in that shot... but the cow was inside the house somehow... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GuerrillaDawg ...Cow was inside the house... i don't even understand. It teleported out a few seconds later. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Wut #PS4share https://t.co/C2DCS98TYM <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @CodeRedShell @Johnnyebs06 @Atari_Barbie Especially on Nintendo stuff... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> SMW is the best 2D Mario... but it's not my personal favorite... SMW2 is. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 Nah. SMW is better is basically ever conceivable way. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Love that almost every round of Hearthstone is against either a face hunter, or a secret pally. That's super fun. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Justinator5000 Nice to see a series develop and mature their character a bit between games. Hasn't happened much in the past. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Justinator5000 Good to know. Glad they improved her. I've tried to ignore most of the media for Rise, since I won't play it until next fall <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> As much as I love the Tomb Raider 2013... Lara was a weak link in that game. Especially if she was supposed to be a strong, empowered woman. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Honestly... I think Evie in AC Syndicate was a better character overall. She definitely seemed more intelligent, and less vulnerable. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Not really sure I agree w/the whole opinion about Lara being the "greatest" female character in games right now... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 Parts of them are fine. Some parts are as Pegg says... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 Sorry... Lucas directed... he co-wrote all of them :| <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 Probably doesn't matter, because popular opinion is that the prequels/Lucas written films were subpar (at best) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> By the end, we've likely got our money's worth from the pass, but it won't feel like it, because most of the DLC has been forgettable. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Lessons to be learned from the Batman AK Season Pass; Most gamers would rather have a few big DLC packs, vs a load of tiny ones <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @fourhman it's the equivalent to the old "cutting room floor" content from movies, except games can actually do something with it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @fourhman Most DLC is either content that couldn't have been finished on budget, or in some cases couldn't be started. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @fourhman Do those people ever learn lessons? DLC is clearly stuff that is intentionally cut from a game for further monetization. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheGameFreakGuy Mobile version is largely incomplete. Probably Vita. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> There are 11 Blaster Types, 13 Star Cards (sub-weapons/iteams),  6 single use "charged" Star Cards, and 5 Trait Cards. Fine w/all of it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> 2) Rebel can be non-human, but not until you reach at least lvl 40. The Twi'lek that they show in the trailer is a lvl50 unlock :| <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> 1)  Empire can only be human. And while the Shadow Trooper is unlockable... it's a lvl50 req. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> There are only 2 things I'm "unhappy" about in Battlefront, looking at the unlocks in the companion app... both related to appearance. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I can't wait to read all the bitching and moaning from people about the "lack of weapon variety" in Battlefront. Dis gonna be good. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Any(fucking)ways...
Kromaia Omega looks cool, but I'm not in a place where I can take a chance on a $30 non-std-indie-SHMUP <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> PC has even less gaemz than PS4, and Nintendo stuff is for babies and pedos. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> By modern gamer logic, Xbox One is the only platform that has games, because it's the only one with highly advertised AAA exclusives. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Wake up to people apparently doing the whole "PS4 haz no gaemz" thing again. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Oh... and randomly, Battlefront has already preloaded. Sony seems to be getting better at pre-loads for major titles (except Fallout 4) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> hmmm...making a lot of dumb mistakes in Fallout. Gonna start over again. Not really playing well enough to do the whole Int/Charisma build. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Earned 8 PS4 trophies (8 bronze) in 2 games - https://t.co/p4uUPiZ39W <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Nope. https://t.co/0YrV11eO4Y <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheGameFreakGuy Past years had snow flakes, and holly. Not as if Starbucks put out cups with the manger, or baby Jesus. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheGameFreakGuy Also a coffee cup that had never displayed anything religiously affiliated w/the "Christian" version of Christmas. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> L OH FUCKING L https://t.co/CbI7s17voF <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis meh... I don't now. It's got a bit more personality than some of the holiday sizzle reel BS commercials they did in the past. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 @TheGameFreakGuy He's holding out for Battlefield Pokemon Edition... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis outside of the fact that white people can't dance.... whats the problem. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Stealth___ "everybody" being the small percentage of the community that still "bleeds" Nintendo. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Guessing they jacked up the CAD price of the pass to $40. Because thx Harper for fucking the Canadian dollar. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @johnnydork I'd play both. Probably beat Tomb Raider in between loading sequences in Fallout. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm not convinced that this project isn't killing me inside a bit. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> 3rd pass on this stupid fucking documentation I'm doing has made me significantly more bitter than usual. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Wii/Wii U/3DS has taught me that I am not Nintendo's target audience. I don't understand who is. Still, I'd like access to their classics. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The only thing I'd like Nintendo to ever announce is a less dirtbaggish approach to the Virtual Console. With some legit support for it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NintendoTweet Well... they've already done that for the most part. That's the real reason for the Zelda "delay". <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NintendoTweet That they announce they're going 3rd party... or mobile only... just to see the salt. lol <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> :| The only thing preventing me from selling my *new* 3DS is the hassle of private sale right now, and the fact EBgames w/give me fuck all. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch Spent ~5-6hrs (maybe more) trying to get the stupid shit to work. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch It was quite literally unplayable with Wii-Motion Plus for me. Combat was unresponsive, and just didn't work. So, no. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch Skyward Sword is one of the worst games I've played, not just the worst Zelda. Shit is full-on unplayable. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch They aren't remastering Skyward Sword. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Nintendo fans getting excited for Nintendo to tell you about games they've already told you about... and not mention Zelda. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> If I remember correctly, PC Exclusive announcements, and FPEES/ONETHOUSANDANDEIGHTYPEES discussions are the things I rate higher. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> A Nintendo Direct announcement. The 3rd least exciting gaming related thing I can think of... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I've spent more time "playing" Neko Atsume on my phone in the past week, than I've spent on my 3DS in months. Really need to sell that thing <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis bad = hilarious. Especially the shitty Havoc physics. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis never could get into Snake Eater. MGS1 is the only other game in the series I'd say I like at all. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Same. Which do you put above though? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I've played 3hrs of Fallout 4... so if I was a gaemz media personality, I could say confidently that it's my AAA GotY. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis I'm the definition of edgy. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> After buying Syndicate, and Fallout 4... the next title I'm getting is another one that edgy core gamers are gonna shit on. Battlefront. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Trade in your PS4/XB1... lose $170 on a new PS4/XB1. PLSCANI...WHEREDOISIGNUP <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> That whole trade in your PS4/XB1 to get $250 towards a new PS4/XB1 is an even bigger screw job in Canada. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @bfletchtone I did 3...years and years ago... It felt really bad, the second you went and played Guild Wars 2, or almost any modern MMO. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @bfletchtone oh... BGs... yeah, those are mostly fine. Arena is poop though. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @bfletchtone CAD-USD exchange makes WoW a non-option anyway, but i was hoping that they'd actually make a more robust expansion. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @bfletchtone Really? I've never been able to understand the draw of WoWs PvP. PvE stuff seems real light. Lot of shortcuts being taken. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheGameFreakGuy They may not understand it, but they do. The only people I see with Nintendo handhelds are adults... never young kids. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheGameFreakGuy sort of a general issue I have... lot of kids games, treat kids like idiots... so they get bored, and go back to Minecraft. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheGameFreakGuy ...mmm... debatable. From the demo, it felt a little disrespectful of peoples intelligence. Even children. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ...man... Legion does not sound good. Like at all. And it's not gonna be done for another 8 or 9 mths, how? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheGameFreakGuy :| BF seems so dull now. Entire genre has just left that series behind. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Shame that almost every Android phone is trash... and iPhones are double the cost they should be... making this upgrade process a pain. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch :| I've had less launch day probs with fallout than I have with a lot of so called "better" games. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheGameFreakGuy So you're tired of none boring military shooters. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It's not the retarded bend tests that have me concerned about the 6P... its the glass shattering, possibly due to temp change. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Made it to the part where you can start building a settlement in F4. UX is a bit clunky as a whole, but it mostly works. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Fallout 4 isn't going to be a disappointment for me, because I'm getting what I wanted (and what I expected); More Fallout. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm playing a female character, because the Black Widow perk is generally pretty OP... and a bucket full of lolz to use. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> FPS isn't an issue up to this point... but random load stutters are. Nothing game breaking, but I'm an hour and change into a 400hr game. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The whole "da gaem lokkz lik a PEESTWO gaem" is at best hyperbole, and at worst just edgy "core" gamer bullshit. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> VATs has been refined. Tends to feel less jarring. Out of VATs combat feels a bit tighter as well. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Played an hour and half or so of Fallout 4. Probably a lot longer than I should have, all things considered. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> One day I will go back to Witcher 3. Probably restart when I do. Never played a game that made a worse first impression at launch. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> My KD w/the Gorgon is 1.60. My KD w/every other weapon is 0.60. Pretty sure I found my gun. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheGameFreakGuy Do you not have the disk? Just remove and reinstall... patch probably got corrupted. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheGameFreakGuy pretty sure it's you're borderline dial up internet... cause BF4 (and Hardline... and Battlefront) all run perfect for me. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 Nah... that's probably the 6th best Mario. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 It's the 4th best Mario title, behind Galaxy 1, Sunshine, and SMW <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> #PS4share https://t.co/TP4kefsRp2 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Hmmm... might have found a gun I'm halfway decent at in BLOPSIII <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Coffee. BLOPS. Wait for Fallout to unlock. Or at least wait to see if I can stay up late enough. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch I also have a keyboard for my iPad, so I can use the card filters a lot easier than the average tablet player. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch UX is more intuitive on tablet. The phone version is a sub-par port, but good considering the limitations. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch ur high. Hearthstone could run at 1FPS and still be the same game. FPS has 0 impact. Dat bait is strong. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch ...FPS on a CCG. Pls. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch but all of them play better on tablet, than on PC. Except maybe Grimrock. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch My copies of FTL, Hearthstone, Dungeon of the Endless, and Legend of Grimrock on my iPad say Hi. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The difference between FB and Twitter for me today has been that FB has people excited for Fallout, and Twitter has people shitting on it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Ate an unhealthy amount of sushi at the wife's bday dinner. Gud timez. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Justinator5000 60fps of death. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @browland1 that game is good shit. Shame Canada got shafted on the price. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @fourhman ...why? Why would anyone look for that? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @snazz64 It plays like a relic of 90s shooters. Words can not express my level of disappointment with what I played. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 if life is amiibo plastic <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 ur high. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mp1990GAF After Chronicles 3D, Nintendo couldn't pay me to play that game lol. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @browland1 Agreed. And yes... that fight... :| <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Of course. Supporting Big Business is 100% worse than doing something that's illegal. Murder &gt; Shop at Gamestop. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Buying Used is definitely worse. You're supporting shitty retailers doing that... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @passthemstickss Axiom Verge, Hotline Miami 2, Everybody's Gone to the Rapture, OlliOlli 2, and Tearaway Unfolded. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Accessory Gaemz Media folk being edgy and shitting on open world games/Fallout. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I hate Hearthstone about every other week, but I'll probably still buy the new adventure pack, because I'm in too deep not to. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GuerrillaDawg My (soon to be) child is named (in part) after a video game character... but I'd never think to ask GAF for help. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @wlatham92 Dafuq... So basically the mode lacks any form of balance. How are people championing that mode as the best in the game then? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @wlatham92 How does REQ differ than the cases you can get in Battlefield or COD? Is it basically the same shit? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @wlatham92 I was being mostly sarcastic. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @wlatham92 But they're free. How can you complain about free content? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheGameFreakGuy Honestly, you shouldn't go to that site anyway. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AW_141 Gies is my hero. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm still pretty convinced that LOLygon knocked the score of BLOPSIII down by a couple of points because of the Sony cross-marketing. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AW_141 That the Xbone version of Fallout is "VERY SLIGHTLY LESS JANKY" than the PS4 version. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Gies shilling for Xbone is about as surprising as the sky being blue, or my cats being fat. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Daily AAA games r poop post <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Honestly, if you want good Western RPGs on PS4, get Wasteland 2 or Divinity <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @passthemstickss I don't think Witcher 3 is terrible, but it's at best a 7/10 based on the 5-10hrs I played through. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @passthemstickss lol nah. W3 ran like crap, and didn't look great. Combat was boring. Most of the mechanics like crafting were terrible. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheFrugster Wasteland 2, or Dragon Age Inquisition. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Game was inferior to Dragon Age Inquisition in literally every conceivable way. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Witcher 3 dick-riding is probably my least favorite gaming trend of this year. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Was waiting to see someone claim that Witcher 3 was better than Fallout 4. Clearly people played a different Witcher 3 than I did. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Dreamscythe I notice it in almost every major AAA game. It's usually just less obvious, but it's there. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Dreamscythe I was just playing the BLOPSIII campaign on the weekend. Tons of low res textures and low poly-count models. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Dreamscythe Sure. I'm just saying that a lot of other games get away with it, and no one says anything. Almost every AAA game does it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Dreamscythe I suppose... The critique is only valid if every other game is treated the same, which isn't the case. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Issues aren't really excusable, but they are consistent with Bethesda's games. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> As expected, most of the negative impressions from Fallout 4 come from people that had unrealistic expectations of Bethesda. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @passthemstickss @wlatham92 I just watched the other ending on YT. Honestly didn't feel like either was THAT bad. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @wlatham92 Chapter 5 didn't really bother me. I apparently got the "good" ending though... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mp1990GAF I really liked TR2013. If I still had my Xbone, I'd probably have bought it...but I have too much to play as it is. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mp1990GAF I'll wait a year to save $400. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mp1990GAF Why? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @johnnydork @ItsameDennis Block everyone. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @passthemstickss I'll be cutting back a lot starting... right about now. My Backlog is just shy of 150 games... so I have lots to play. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @passthemstickss Including PS+ titles, I have ~250 on PS4. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It's not quite the tranq dart to the dick that a PC Exclusive game announcement is... but it's pretty close. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Sorry... Backwards compatibility, 2 years into the console life cycle, just isn't exciting... like at all. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis disappointing. 0FPS is true cinematic experience. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis I'm giving Fallout 4 my AAA GotY award. Which means either I'm crazy... or AAA has been shit this year. Or both. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I have a theory that the BD in the PS4 is sort of shit, and the disc reads/checks cause performance drops. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm curious if the folks that didn't experience frame rate issues in F4 on PS4 were digital, or physical. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheSharkSurname tomorrow <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Awww...no edgy scores for Fallout 4. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Justinator5000 Glad that they gave the weapon more options... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Justinator5000 I used the bow for most of the reboot. Didn't like that you essentially had to use guns near the end to fight the Oni. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Curious to see/hear if Rise gives more combat options. You could do most of the reboot w/the bow... until you couldn't. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I wish I could play Rise of the Tomb Raider now... but not enough to regret having sold my XB1, or want to buy a new one. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis I like the "Fallout" world. I'm expecting something similar to 3 &amp; NV. Also... This is how the internet works. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @PranooYY embargo is up in about 40mins <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Fallout 4 will probably still be my AAA GotY, because I love that world, and I expect Bethesda's stuff to be inexcusably busted. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis except Witcher 3... Which was no where near as impressive as the hype cycle built it up to be... And it still ran like shit. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> My only real Fallout Defense Force comment is that the game will suffer because of peoples mismanaged expectations. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm super excited to see the...
FALLOUT...
From these review scores. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @PranooYY that's totally America for you...shame the child died, and not the shitty parents. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Don't worry PlayStation fans... We get a Rise of the Tomb Raider HD remaster next year. #badbaitizbad <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> (as a note; MKX is last NetherRealm game I buy.) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> People keep buying it though, because they see ads showing you being able to play as Jason and the Predator. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> MKX is the top selling game so far this year, and a core portion of the game, online... doesn't work properly, and never will. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Enthusiast press, and the core gamer have almost no effect on how AAA does business, because we account for such a small % of their market. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I actually kind of hope the "big" game sites give Fallout 4 mediocre reviews, just so the sales can prove their irrelevance. again. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> SE was disappointed with the reboot, when it had announced 4.5mil sales after it's first holiday. No way Rise does even a quarter of that. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It'll be interesting to see how much the exclusivity deal hurts Rise of the Tomb Raiders sales. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> At this point, I'm fully expecting a bunch of sites to be edgy and give Fallout 4 a 6/10. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Cool to hear that Tomb Raider is actually good. I was legitimately afraid that they wouldn't be able to improve on the reboot. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis both. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis he's a PR guy... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Tomb Raider threads will be the same style of shit. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> These Fallout 4 review threads are gonna make me want to burn everything down... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @browland1 @Joesff if memory serves me right, it was 3rd or 4th on my list. Sort of glad the PS4 version is next yr. Lack the time or money <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @browland1 That's about 99% likely. I'm curious for the scores, just to see if it'll be worth getting next year. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Dats a wrap on the BLOPSIII campaign. Nice change from their normal racist BS. That's 53 on the year. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GuerrillaDawg ...I'm gonna roll up some newspaper and swat the shit out of you... :| Bad Dawg. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheFrugster Bloodborne's yes. Witcher... sort of. Still feels "off", but apparently it's close to 30 most of the time now. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis @GuerrillaDawg Well... it ran at about 22-25 FPS most of the time until the patch <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis @GuerrillaDawg And it was consistently bad everywhere, rather than select locations/situations. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GuerrillaDawg Are you being ironic with that?
Framerate issues are framerate issues. Double standard is sort of crazy. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GuerrillaDawg Sort of like everyone defending Witcher 3s frame rate issues... or Bloodbornes... or whatever... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mp1990GAF Probably not. Box says from the makers of Skyrim. That's all it needs to for it to sell 10mil copies. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NintendoTweet no, I just assume, because those platforms have the most perv-y weeb games. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ...Fallout 4's DL is a little over 32gbs to dl. Fun. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NintendoTweet Must be a Vita/3DS gamer <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis True story. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Gotta dick ride the only dev capable of making an engine that's more poorly optimized than the Cryengine. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis 
*they're...ffs <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Because it's CDPR, and they don't like DRM... so their gods. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> GAF appears to be going full retard on the Fallout threads. Why do I ever look/read any of the shit from that site? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> When all the so called "gamers" shit on Battlefront during the beta... I had a great time. To the point where I bought the Season Pass. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Thankfully, I'm so desensitized to this shitty community, so my excitement/interest for the title hasn't been dampened at all. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Fallout 4 pre-load for PS4 is finally up. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Earned 5 PSN trophies (4 bronze and 1 silver) in 2 games - https://t.co/p4uUPiZ39W <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Twitch &amp; YT are working to shutdown Fallout 4 streams. lol gud luck with that <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Gets even worse when you go down to the studio level... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> This community and it's double standard when it comes to publishers is nuts. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Kami_Elma Xenoblade is one of the worst JRPGs I've played. Bad combat system. What ever story was there, was ruined by the MMO-like systems <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> To be fair, BLOPSIII is mostly solid. Dips are in cinematics. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It's nice that Dying Light and MGSV are the only AAA games I've played all year that had stable frame rates. Welcome to next gen. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Kami_Elma If it's anything like Chronicles, I'll take a pass <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Justinator5000 I used to work in QA, but in software. I understand it's not always the easiest to think of crazy shit end users will do. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Justinator5000 I'm a bit more forgiving of games where the issues are isolated. Unity and Witcher 3 on PS4 ran like poo start to finish. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch I'm going to get the 6P. So that should solve a lot of my issues. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Justinator5000 True. I just don't get how you make a game, have it run like a flipbook at times, and say "yup, that's fine" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch Lenovo's plan for Motorola appears to sell low cost phones, but force upgrades w/new hardware. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch When Moto was owned by Google, they were good with it. Since the Lenovo buyout they're being shit <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch ...I have to wait for my new phone. Lenovo is being shit about updating the Moto X 2nd gen line. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Justinator5000 ...like war...
Seriously though, devs should have a bit more pride in their work. Especially with ports developed "in house" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Poorly performing games on console is just as inexcusable as it is on PC, but I can at least understand the hesitance on PC (piracy). <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Honestly, saying "you should just play it on PC" is a retarded stance to take. Build your software to work on platforms you release it on. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> So... Fallout review threads will be filled with console defenders, bethesda defenders, and PC Master Racers. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis nah, shit FPS is shit. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis ummm nah. City didn't have a good narrative <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheWorldWarGame Still a great game... I just think it's sort of crazy to judge open world titles harshly based on story. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheWorldWarGame Individual pieces were fine. Some sections that were done to extend the game though, and the "pacing" felt off at times. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> You can have solid "set pieces", but the story is always going to feel sub-par because of the pacing. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheWorldWarGame Not especially no... pacing the narrative is easily the biggest problem with that game. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The reality is, I feel for the writers of open-world titles. There has never been a solid narrative told via open world... it's impossible. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheWorldWarGame It's impossible to implement a proper narrative in an open-world title. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Fallout has the same issues as Witcher 3. 
It doesn't look good. The writing is "meh". The FPS is shit. 
But...hey... the world is cool <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheWorldWarGame Same people that say Fallout 3 and NV story is crap. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheWorldWarGame If all you're play is Single Player... of course... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Stealth___ Pack-in 3D Mario isn't a great idea. Average Joe Casual doesn't tend to like the 3D games. It won't push units. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Nuk3town man... Nuk3town. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch Their penises... https://t.co/Gdq8u1AkIZ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> nah... not gonna beat BLOPSIII tonight... no rush. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Was about to say that this CoD campaign had felt pretty grounded, all things considered... and then it went completely off the rails. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AsukaLSorhyu My PS4 says I have 44mpbs... I have 250...on gig LAN. The network test is a lie. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ultimate_forc3e Doesn't seem like it, feels about on par with the past few games. Hardened is probably easily doable. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ultimate_forc3e Regular. It's pretty std CoD difficulty... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The proper censoring for Mika would be to remove her from the game. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Awww... The Canadian guy didn't win the Hearthstone World Championships... oh well. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Anywho... back to BLOPS. Might beat the SP tonight... who knows. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Yeah...sorry that ur fap-bait character was a little too fap-bait-y, so they toned her down a touch. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> People are upset that the fucking shitty fan service character in SFV got censored... PLS. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch ...wut... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> My favourite part of the annualized games is picking out the objects and textures where they cut corners... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mp1990GAF r u high... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I dont really consider Tearaway AAA, since the original project was done by a handful of people as a side "thing" at MM <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It's apparently time for my daily "AAA vidya gaemz r trash" posts. Can't think of a single AAA title I'd give over an 8/10 this year. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch for the record, I don't disagree that F4 will likely deserve a 7... but most of the 9s this year have... so it'll get a 9. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch 360 port of W2 looked like poop though. I play it on PC originally though, and it wasn't optimized well their either. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch CDPR just can't optimize their engine. It's not like the PC versions are better... you can just brute force them. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch nah. Definitely not on consoles. Even then, the combat is pretty dull and it's just another open world collectathon <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch In a world where Witcher 3 got 9s... I fucking hope not. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Basically pushes me to either PvZGW2 (which no one will buy unfortunately), or Overwatch... which everyone will buy, but won't play in a wk. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Reassessing my feels/opinions about Battleborn. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Well... that's fun. Apparently the single player campaign is tied to the MP servers... so if I play "local" I need to restart the campaign. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Cool Story Bro #PS4share https://t.co/5bZyz26RJs <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Earned 6 PS4 trophies (1 bronze, 4 silver and 1 gold) in 2 games - https://t.co/p4uUPiZ39W <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Any tweet that includes waifu, bae, or yolo is pure trash. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> That's probably in my top 10 worst tweets ever <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Battery is the best CoD Waifu. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Made my day to get a round ending kill cam w/full gib on the War Machine. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm gonna drink a Mountain Dew after the next tweet... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> TFW someone on your PSN friends list is playing the game that you want to be playing... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It's a terrible joke, but I'm not here to be funny. Srsly though, I hope she at least gets a couple days to relax before the baby comes <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It's my wife's last day of work before mat leave... I keep joking that she's going to go into labour right at the end of her work day. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Half the BLOPSIII players are in TDM. Because half the BLOPSIII players have shitty taste in game modes. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Good times. You also break every game you play... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Ori and Batman are probably tied for my biggest disappointments of the year. I didn't really expect to like Witcher 3 anyway. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I typically don't say a game I haven't beaten is one of my games of the year... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Talos goes on my list (it's new on PS4)... which knocked Bloodborne off my top 10. BB shouldn't have been there in the 1st place... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ...as it stands right now, the closest thing to AAA on my top 10 list for the year is Tearaway Unfolded. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> One day (likely in the near future), when I can't afford to buy as many games, I'll go back for Platinums <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Yay me
The Talos Principle
Free Will(Gold) #PS4share https://t.co/bTicnS4bws https://t.co/gyx1dUldFL <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Beat Talos Principle. 52 games on the year. Probably should do the expansion eventually too. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch lol your potential GotY is my biggest disappointment of the year. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I has no RL gamer friends, and MOBAs (and moba-likes) are painful AF to play w/PUGs <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Man... I'm gonna shit on Overwatch a bunch, but there's a good chance I'll pick it up over Battleborn because of MOBA-like BS. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> As expected... Dennis appears to have broken Fallout 4. Slightly slower than expected :} <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> OBJ fuckers have got to me. I'm done w/BLOPSIII for a bit. Gonna drink my coffee and play some more Talos <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch Fake Endor. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheWorldWarGame MP is really solid. Zombies is fun too. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheWorldWarGame Literally no way the game can live up to the majority of peoples expectations. New gen hype trains are crazy stuff. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @passthemstickss Good. They should live with that shame forever. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> You can always tell the people that only play CoD on their consoles by their fuckin' stupid PSN names. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> oh snap... Zombies might actually work... It's a miracle... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mp1990GAF It's because hearting things made you a homosexual or something. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Glad PC Players get Helldivers. You guys need some actual good games on ur trash platform #amitrollin <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 Tomb Raider... definitely. I like the Order... but I'm not sure it's for most. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm glad everyone is as shocked about Overwatch being retail as I am. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> So... A SC exp I won't buy, more weird stuff for HotS, a HS exp that pushes more shitty RNG, and a retail price on a game that looks F2P <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> That's probably the worst open cinematic for a WoW expansion. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> So Overwatch is straight up retail... and it's apparently $60 USD... that seems... over priced. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Overwatch has some decent character design. Not sure I prefer it to Battleborn's though... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> lol <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Overwatch time. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> well... that was significantly better than I expected <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Wonder if Helldivers is Sony's first published PC title since Playstation's inception... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Interesting to see the Nintendo faithfuls reaction to the new Wii U bundles... vs literally anyone else. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> wtf is shotty snipers? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> nah... Game Informer didn't try to say those awful LoS Castlevania games were a good reboot. GTFO <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> On the upside, I actually enjoy the new Zombies... something I can't say about the past versions. Feels less generic. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> If the bug happens, then MP is dead until you restart the game. :| <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> So there's definitely a bug in Zombies MP. Basically the servers don't limit the lobby, and it tries to connect too many people. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Earned 7 PS4 trophies (6 bronze and 1 silver) in 2 games - https://t.co/p4uUPiZ39W <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Sometimes I feel like my work life is straight out of a Dilbert comic. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ultimate_forc3e Not really a new thing tbh. Been like this since BLOPSII... It's not great, but it's a way to sell DLC I guess. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MonsefMA lol <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ultimate_forc3e 2 if you pre-ordered. And the rest of the maps w/come with the DLC packs. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MonsefMA TDM/DM is for scrubs that aren't actually good at FPS's <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @PranooYY I'll do both... (Buy and Play COD, and play other stuff til F4 gets here) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> rebooted my PS4. Gonna try Zombies again. Don't have the patience for the Day 1 players ruining my OBJ matches today. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> if you want to flex ur dick, go play TDM with the other eleventeen year olds that don't understand how to play. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I don't care how hard your dick gets from going 20-1, but when the team loses because you ignore OBJs... you're a scrub. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Dear CoD players, when playing an OBJ based mode... please go for the OBJs. Thx. Me. Every. Single. Match. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Flunkie Game has crashed for me, booted me out of matchmaking twice, and won't find a match at all now. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ...yeah... so Zombies Online doesn't appear to work at all. At least not on PS4, in Pub matches. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Everybody will get their copy of Fallout 4 before me. Because reasons. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Well... that's interesting... and a first. Online MP for zombies seems a little busted in BLOPSIII <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Always remember, Early Access is great for devs because they get paid w/o ever needing to finish a project https://t.co/y3LbMvWkT4 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> In an alternate timeline, where BLOPSIII was still aligned with Microsoft, Gies would have given that game a 9. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm reminded why Polygon is the least trust worthy source for review scores almost every day. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 I'll let you know when the pre-orders are up on the PSN. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 Blizzard's new (potentially) F2P arena shooter w/moba-ish elements. RUEXCITED <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @iAsobu Like I said... almost all the cross-over games are like this. FE for 3DS only sold well because of it's push to the weeb audience. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NintendoTweet $14... how will she afford starbucks? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @iAsobu ...ummm ok? There was no "literal porn" in the footage that's been shown. Game is pretty typical anime. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> :| Banner Saga console editions delayed. Banner Saga 2 delayed. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @iAsobu What was the problem w/SMTxFE (or whatever it's called)? It's a fan service game. Almost all crossovers are. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> As DEWgusting as it is, if Overwatch Origins on console includes beta access w/the pre-order, I'll probably bite. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I want to go to a game store to watch all the 30 somethings buy Yo-kai, and see all the 8yr olds buying BLOPSIII <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis lolno. Unless it's supposed to represent this gens tendency to release half finished products... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 And BLOPSIII day... which is what all of Yokai's target demographic will be playing lol. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @passthemstickss As in the placement/angle is awkward AF. I also have small-ish hands... so might be part of my issue. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> $130USD version of a game that's most likely still going to have a F2P option. kkblizznicetry. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @passthemstickss Feels pretty normal on the DS4. Layout is sort of designed for that. I like the Xb1 controller, but the bumpers are ass. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @passthemstickss I assume you play with index finger on the trigger then? I usually do index on bumper, middle on trigger. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @passthemstickss It remaps tactical grenades to X... so smoke/flares... and who cares about those (at least in CoD) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @passthemstickss Nah. Jumping with X takes away from your ability to aim in mid air. That's why shit like the Elite Controller exist. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> .@TheWordofRawr specifically, a face button. Jump needs to be a shoulder button, so you don't have to take your thumb away from your aim. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> They also still get my thumbs up for including bumper jumper... because playing a shooter with a button to jump is just wrong. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Played through the first full mission in BLOPSIII. The SRS-ness of it, is comical, as usually, and the pacing is slower. I like it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It is pretty funny that Blizz thinks people are gonna stick around for another 9+ mths, when there's already nothing to do. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis and a MMORPeeGEE the only thing worse than MOOOOOBBBBBAAAA <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> In Canada, that works out to a $60-$65 expansion pack, with a ~$20/mth sub fee. Nah, I'll pass, even if I am interested. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Totally forgot that Blizz was jacking up the price of the WoW Exp. $50+sub, with the lack of content in the recent exp is kinda gross. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis He's like...8... Of course he does. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis you can have 2 active systems though. He's going to be offline, except to download games. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis I want to make it so the account has access to my library. Think I found the option... I just need to test it out. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> My nephew might actually be getting a PS4 for xmas. Need to figure out how to set him up with a sub-account on the PSN. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> PS4 pre-load of Fallout 4 isn't starting until Sunday. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> 2-10 on my first round of BLOPSIII. I'm going to go with the excuse that I haven't had coffee yet... 'cause that's bad, even for me. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Ok... $40 MSRP on Overwatch is fine. Just not prepared to pay $80 CAD. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheGameFreakGuy Vice City <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm guessing that Fallout has an "anti-consumer" embargo... or some equally self-entitled bs <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GuerrillaDawg Ur not having a good day man... :| <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I managed to hit Trophy Level 19. woo. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It's TFW you come across a Linux server that has 5 applied monitoring templates all labelled IIS. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Actually had to triple check something today, because I was so confused as to wtf was going on... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @victoredfield DS3 is the cash grab I don't want. No reason for that game to exist already. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> My interest in Overwatch is limited due to Blizzards inability to balance any of their other games properly. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Reason 542 as to why I'm a bad person; Dark Souls III is my least anticipated game for next year. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis You're getting F4 early? Can't wait to see you break that game :| <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Until? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis I should post more on GAF. Shitting on games you don't play, and never would, is basically why that site exists. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis probably not, but I'll never play Halo 5. Not sure I would have bought it, even if I still had my Xbone. Looks boring AF. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis for making what? The worst 2 Halo games... how about no. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis basically everything not PC Master Race-centric that isn't Destiny. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis They're the best of the devs in charge of CoD... and I'd say they're probably the best studio making Dorito class shooters. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis ur high <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> For the record, Android is only shit if you're not running vanilla. It's the shovelware that Samsung and friends throw on top that ruin it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Those Polygon Op Eds are always bait. Shit opinions, posted to the internet, to get clicks. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> If games impact your decision to buy a phone, you probably shouldn't be allowed to own a phone. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Earned 12 PSN trophies (8 bronze and 4 silver) in 3 games - https://t.co/p4uUPiZ39W <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Real Talk; Who ever EA hired to do the marketing campaign for Battlefront deserves a raise. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Kotaku brought up the interesting point that even though HotS is f2p, there's a $20 retail pack. Here's hoping Overwatch is the same <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Yeah... so according to IGN, Blizz didn't deny the Overwatch: Origins edition for consoles that was up for Gamestop. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @johnnydork Yeah... that guy is either joking, a hardcore Xbot, or going for a super obvious bait. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @johnnydork That's a satire account right? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I suspect that console confirmation, release window, and possible pricing model, will be announced at Blizzcon for Overwatch. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Nice comparisons between the XB1 and Xbox versions of BLOPSIII circulating.... wait... that's 360... dafuq!?! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> If the game is full retail, and doesn't have a SP mode, I'm not sure why/how you buy it over Battleborn. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Obvious Leak iz Obvious. Not sure how I feel about Overwatch being a retail title vs F2P though. Game seems a little shallow. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheGameFreakGuy What's wrong with it? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @wlatham92 its a DQ game... on 3DS... of course it wasn't localized. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Everyone got too caught up in the "open world-i-ness" of FC4, and didn't clue into the awful encounter design and worse story. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I also think Far Cry is a shit franchise since Ubi took it over, and Deus Ex is a shell of it's former self. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> As expected, the general reaction to the PvZGW2 release date is negative. It'll probably still be the best game of the 3 on that day. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> EA actually did something similar w/the original PvZGW... which was release it right by Titanfall. It's not a budget release this time... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Renton127 It's MP maps, and Zombie Levels. Usually 4 MP maps and 1 Zombie level per pack, and there's 4 packs <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ...So now instead of Mirror's Edge against Deus Ex and Far Cry... EA is sending PvZGW2 off to die. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Raptors are the only local(-ish) sports team I care about. Leafs and Jays can die in a fire. And MLS... lulz. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Raps are going to end up being stupid, and giving DeRozan a max deal in the off-season... and we'll continue to have poor shooting team. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Raps are 5-0 to start the season... but have played either bad, or under-achieving teams. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> For the record, Titanfall was probably the XB1 game I spent the 2nd most time with. It's the only CoD-like I've ever "prestiged" in <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Wonder how many reviewers will say BLOPS3 is Titanfall with all the stuff no one liked removed... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> For whatever reason, I thought Talos Principle was supposed to be really short like Portal... I was mistaken. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheFrugster As in BoI? AFAIK yes, it's due out before the end of the year. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Maybe this will be the CoD that I hit prestige <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis lol so GAF is gonna be GAF on this one. I can't wait. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis lol gud timez. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Anyone know when the BLOPS3 embargo is? Not like it effects my purchase... but I like to read it for the LOLz <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Here's my old list; https://t.co/HxqeHfUaMQ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis I don't usually track indies. Your list is pretty solid. I'd have to see if I have my old list <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis 0% chance I am. I'll be lucky if I can squeeze out the indies I want, and PSVR. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis They've shown slightly less than nothing at this point. I'll care more when it's a real game lol. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Re-Core is on your list... fucking shameful. Don't give Inafune any more money. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Mine's "done"... but I have no faith some of the stuff will release in 2016. Do you include indies on your list? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> anywho... Liking Dragon Fin Soup more now that I got a handle on the controls. They're still poop, but it doesn't hurt the game too much. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Honestly, I'd shit on that game if it was a PS4 exclusive. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Let's all pretend for a sec that Inafune isn't trash, and Armature has released a good game. PLS B EXCITE FOR RECORE <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Cool, bullshit Streamers appear to have BLOPSIII already. Definitely not my least favorite thing in the world or anything... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch TBH tho...it's your fault for not hating CoD you Activision shill...You need to be a Nintendo shill. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch Good ole Nintendoyearolds... Working to make that company even more unlikable. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Renton127 Single player for Splatoon only took about 3 1/2 hours... more if you took your time. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> NFS is sorta easy...Multiple crashes... still beat time trial by 20secs. <Text_End>

https://t.co/2OMT3dWPjF https://t.co/Zh1I1tWqa0 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I can't think of anything in gaming I care about less than resolution and framerate wars. Just make sure your FPS is 30 &amp; stable. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Exclusive screenshot in 900p glory from the new Tomb Raider... it's f'in beautiful man... https://t.co/XgTUEROpRs <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Easy joke iz easy. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch ...man... have you not seen the screenshots of the game... https://t.co/lb01XtWzwR <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Don't shit on the dreams of the PC Master race man... they'll come and 4K all over your face. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 not exactly a high bar... and it's getting mixed reviews... as Pokemon would if it didn't have the "from Nintendo" label on it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis True story. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis lol That chart proves how little the "hardcore" gamer matters. It's fantastic. Our opinions are meaningless. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> GAF is great because it'll never become aware of it's own lack of importance. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis I love the GAF comments of ZOMG PEOPLEZ BI DIS STUFFZ EETZ SHEET <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Earned 12 PS4 trophies (10 bronze and 2 silver) in 3 games - https://t.co/p4uUPiZ39W <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Joesff GTA3, Vice City, San Andres, and 4 all got 10s too. Hell... Soul Calibur on DC was one of the first 10s IGN gave out... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Joesff That game most certainly doesn't deserve a 10. Love Prime, but it's not a perfect game... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Sites try to say that 10 isn't a "perfect" score, but why you do a single grade scoring system, you're bullshitting yourself. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> MGSV doesn't deserve a 10. Witcher 3 didn't deserve 10s. GTAV didn't deserve 10s. TLoU didn't deserve 10s. Nothing deserves a perfect score. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> MGSV, a game that its own community hates, is the highest rated AAA game this year. I love it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Can you imagine the salt if Fallout 4 gets anything less than a 10 after all the 10s that (apparently) unfinished MGSV got. Glorious. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> *insert game* has Day 1 patch. It's *insert size*. Why is this news anymore... it's essentially every game. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GuerrillaDawg I assume you mean the same shit that I just pointed out... "400mil in Software and Hardware" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Not a fan of MS, or the Xbox brand, but at this point competition is good as it might cause Sony to stop sitting on their hands. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It's nice that it's apparently moving HW, but I can't help but feel like the game is lacking the post launch hype of previous Halo games. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> MS Halo statement is sorta bullshit, since they're counting the Halo HW bundle as part of their haul for the game... but whatever. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The beta for Indivisible felt really good. It's a shame that game doesn't look like it's going to happen. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Uncharted 4 has been pretty bad as well... and I'm afraid it's going to be worse. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ...At this point, I'm pretty sure we've seen the entirety of Rise of the Tomb Raider through promo vids. One of the worst cycles I've seen. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> lol nothing like losing a race because you run into a lamp post on the last corner. Gud timez <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I suppose "rubber banding" happens if you fuck up once in a race... because the AI will make up a lot of ground... as they should. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Also played more NFS. Really like the game, regardless of some of the justifiable complaints. Still haven't seen the rubber banding... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Skill based platformers should always allow you to play using the dpad, since the stick is bullshit for that kind of stuff. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Funny enough, Poncho, one of the other indie games on the PSN this week, also has control/control design issues. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Dragon Fin Soup is a decent Mystery Dungeon like game, that could benefit greatly from tightening up of the controls. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> for pre-ordering Battlefront on the PSN, I got a 25% off coupon to buy either stuff I already had, or didn't want... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @hanmik01 but 14yrs are going to play it... and act like douches. Battlefront is going to be full of Star Wars nerds. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @hanmik01 At this point, I'd probably pick Battlefront... because I'm getting old, and it's more casual. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Soon #PS4share https://t.co/CdHxOrl7E2 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @hanmik01 I've literally bought both already. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @TributeGames: Curses N Chaos is 25% OFF for North American PS+ members! #psplus Go punch monsters HERE: https://t.co/LOw0TCFhfQ https:/… <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GuerrillaDawg driving takes some getting used to, and some work to get a decent car. Didn't really experience rubber banding <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GuerrillaDawg If it means anything (which it doesn't), I liked the beta. Played about 6-8hrs of it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Flunkie @ItsameDennis @johnnydork Shovel Knight was super easy...disappointingly so tbh <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Nah... I'm done. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm content creating over this shitty podcast. Like, subscribe, and go to my Patreon. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> "Civ Rev 2 Plus is exclusive to Vita." "It's gonna be great"
Nah... It's a port of the iOS game... Which was crap. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch @TheFrugster @ItsameDennis they got good money for the DLC though. They explained back then why they picked Indiegogo <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> 2.5mil units sold. "Those aren't very good numbers". Why the fuck are people giving them money... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch @TheFrugster @ItsameDennis it's because Skullgirls had no issues, and KS funding is apparently shitty comparatively. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Now they're shitting on Mirror's Edge. This is actually retarded. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch @TheFrugster @ItsameDennis not even fucking close... Which sucks. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @PranooYY unfortunately, yes. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis it's just you and me... And our Minecraft Let's Plays <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis this podcast reminds me how awful the "new" PlayStation community is. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> These guys have been so awful since leaving IGN. Fucking insufferable. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Hearing Colin bitch about name changing on the PSN makes me want to punch something. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @snazz64 @CodeRedShell I tried. It didn't work. I tried various distances, configs on the sensor bar... lighting... everything. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Sony is doing their best to make it so I can't give them money for unproven products. Why no Alienation or Shadow of the Beast pre-orders? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis looking forward to another 20mins of pissing and moaning about not being able to change your PSN name. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @CodeRedShell I played some Sports Resort. Skywards motion just felt forced, and poorly implemented. I tried various set ups too. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Gonna subject myself to the new, real bad, Playstation podcast on the way home. Not even sure why... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @CodeRedShell ...lol probably speaks volumes about why I'm not a fan of Skyward. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @CodeRedShell Wii, and pretty much everything about it, are largely to blame for my attitude towards Nintendo. Wii U didn't help at all... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @CodeRedShell Yeah... except Skyward Sword... which was an unplayable mess of poor waggle controls :) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Nintendo has made 1 good home console (GCN) in the last 20 yrs, and Nintendo fans think that NX will be "different" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @CodeRedShell Not entirely sure... top 3 are WW, LttP and Minish Cap. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @CodeRedShell I don't think I'll ever understand peoples fascination with OoT. Outside of Skyward, it's my least favorite Zelda. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 https://t.co/kd5gITcRJt <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I live AC... but that Chronicles game is like an Epic PC Exclusive announcement...(pls see previous tweet) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I strongly recommend NOT buying AC Chronicles China. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> If you haven't played Tearaway, it's on sale on the PSN for PS4 this week. Buy it... you heartless bastards. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @johnnydork 2016... hopefully. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I was a PC gamer before it was cool... so I'm allowed to shit on the overrated platform now. Sry guiz. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Valid Possibility 3: PC exclusive early access game that will never be finished <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I just assume that most PC exclusives are either niche strategy games, or F2P. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> A PC exclusive game announcement from Epic is like getting a tranq dart right to the brain. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Dragon Fin Soup is up, with PS+ discount on the NA PSN Store. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 Well... they all sort of look like girls... so who knows. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis It's ok... I'll forget all about the game by next fall when I play the PS4 version... #PS4isthebestbox <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Seeing the Battle of Jakku map (presumably in Walker Assault) justified the rest of that Season Pass to me. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Only Battlefront could release a trailer for DLC, and have it be exciting. Dat Star Wars hype train. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 Neither 3, 4, 5 or Peace Walker should have ever been made. Ending on 4 would have been unfortunate... game was terrible. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 They didn't let it die the first 4 times Kojima wanted off the series... so why would they without him. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Flunkie That's horrible, and I sort of hate you for suggesting that...
Bubble Warcraft Saga <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 Does Square really gain anything from pooping it out if it's not "perfect". Although XIII trilogy sold millions of copies... :| <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 P5 is the only one I think is legitimately releasing next year. TLG is a firm maybe. FFXV is a lolz. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 (legit question btw... KH3, FFXV, and TLG aren't 2016 until they're actually on a store shelf) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 Outside of Street Fighter... what is there? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @SuperNintendad @Mattmanver2 Has Sony confirmed that they're releasing that outside of the SW bundles? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Random thought; Crazy to think that Activision raised the capital to buy King for 6bil, about 2yrs after buying themselves for 8bil <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 I have BLOPS3 before Fallout... but after? Battlefront &amp; Just Cause 3. Plus some random indie stuff. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> If I ever wanted to go back to the "PC Master Race", I'd likely only need a new HDD and maybe more RAM. And I'd have to stop working in IT. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @johnnydork Is that a 4srs 90min long video review of a video game? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I've literally quit twitter 4 or 5 times. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I always love the "That's it, I'm not using *insert social media platform* ever again... it's ruined"... and then never stop. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> People always lose their shit about changes to social media services...ZOMFG NOES THERE ARE HEARTS INSTEAD OF STARS ARGHHHH!!! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mp1990GAF Kojima tried for the last 4 games. Failed every time... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Interested to see if the Blizzcon-Overwatch-Console Beta rumours end up true. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @wlatham92 Nope. They only paid 20% over the current stock price. Given the market value, the price wasn't bad. Market is just stupid. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @wlatham92 (that's $150mil/yr) Issue with this deal is that they are late... King's revenue has been down yr over yr... w/steady Qly drops. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @wlatham92 Agreed. This is MS's fault for paying 2bil for Mojang, when the company only generated $150mil in revenue though. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @wlatham92 Even with Popcap... deal was heavy stock optioned and performance tied. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @wlatham92 Popcap was the only one on the scale of over-valuation as Mojang or King. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ...IGN showing the review scores for the Battlefront book... in place of the scores for the actual game. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @wlatham92 Popcap was really EA's only bad acquisition. Even then... they've suck with it, and played the long game. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Honestly, the King deal isn't any worse than the Minecraft deal. Microsoft just has a lot more money so it doesn't really matter. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @wlatham92 Nope. It's the way most of these knee jerk acquisitions work. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Don't worry though... it's about ethics in gaemz jurnilizm... certainly not a fear of the fap-bait male power fantasies being taken away. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The last year has taught me that there are a lot of frightened man-babies out there. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @CodeRedShell ...wut <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> So Tomb Raider is coming out the same day as both Fallout 4, and the Starcraft II expansion. Good luck with that... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @CodeRedShell Make sure to try Dragon Fin Soup... it looks promising. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> WoW's issue isn't the subscription model. The issue is lack of content to justify the subscription. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @bfletchtone Yep. It's hard to be down on them, when the next closest P2P MMO is sitting at ~1-1.5mil subs <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Dreamscythe Final Fantasy XIV (and XI), EVE Online, a few small-ish ones <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> WoW subs at their lowest number since Dec 2005. Still ~5x the next closest sub-based MMO. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> MGO studio being disbanded isn't a surprise. The likelihood of MGO being at all profitable for Konami is pretty low. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheFrugster the "rubber banding" is peoples ignorance about the draft mechanic. At least it is early on... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheFrugster yup. I was playing it before I left for work. They fixed some of the tech issues I had in the beta, which is nice. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Imagine how unsatisfying a Souls or Monster Hunter game made by Platinum, Ninja Theory or even Rocksteady would be... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Souls and Monster Hunter are conceptually the same in that regard. Poor mechanics + intelligent encounter design = rewarding feeling. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The Souls series gets away with having sub-par combat mechanics, by making the engagements feel rewarding. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @victoredfield yes. It was garbage. Bad animations parred with poor framerate, with constant stutters in combat. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Stealth___ Buying King wasn't the problem... it's the absurd valuation. Revenue is down yr over yr last I checked. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It is pretty funny that King... a company that's yet to prove long term viability, sold for more than Star Wars did. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The only critiques of NFS I agree with are; lack of pause function is dumb, and like Rivals, MP feels undercooked. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> AFAIK, King's profits had bottomed out over the past 12 months or so. Seems like another large company being slow to acquire. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> $6bil for King seems like an absurd over-valuation. Then again... MS paid $2b for Mojang... and they only made $150mil/yr in revenue <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Then again... Witcher 3 was basically unplayable on console at launch... and sites still handed it 9s. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Don't really agree with the lower scores for NFS after the time I had spent with it. Although I get the complaints about the XB1 version. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis ...that shit's different... my games are on my HDD already... and Soony just won't unlock them. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis lol One day I'll figure out why folks get their panties in a bunch about spoils <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis ...you don't like Fallout... why are you buying it. It's like me buying Witcher or Metal Gear... wait... nvm. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Relaxing #PS4share https://t.co/tHRfWFl4ye <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @PranooYY :| I have close to 600 games played... and I'm not even level 19 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheFrugster MGSV. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Thankfully Talos Principle on PS4 is solid. I'm happy I caved <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Half the reason I was hesitant to buy the PS4 version of Talos was the shitty Shadow Warrior port (which is still broken)... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis It doesn't fix any of the issues with the Xbone controller (bad stick layout, shitty shoulder buttons) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Native PC games are great...but console to PC ports usually don't feel like they justify the $$ I've sunk into my shitty rig over the years. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The map and mod support for BLOPS3 on PC should only be exciting, if there's proof the port won't be garbage... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch I get my paid DLC a month early #PS4isthebestbox <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch you should be ashamed... I'm gonna send you my Mountain Dew <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis U fukkin noob. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis man... Git dat red stone <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheGameFreakGuy Honestly, neither... but if I had to pick... I wish I still had my Vita... and not my 3DS <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis That's true. They keep confusing the message, and saying it's a remake... which people think is the same as remaster <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis It's odd that it's a $40 game... it's like Sony doesn't think it'll sell at full MSRP <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The new Ratchet and Clank looks so good.... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Love to get that Mass Effect loot crate... but ~$100 USD is waaaayyyyy too much right now. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis it was double douche-y. Kotaku isn't a reliable source... and PS is the best box. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> That tweet was intentionally douche-y. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> cool... so it looks like the Xbox One version of NFS has performance issues (as per Kotaku). #PS4isthebestbox <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Almost home time. yay. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis That's nothing... they're the same ones that had someone from Epic saying a game from a different dev was delayed. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis What kinda Xbox dickriding trash did they post this time? I'm curious... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Yup. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis https://t.co/zri7GPBEOJ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @johnnydork Angst-y "gaemer" being angst-y. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @johnnydork Still don't really understand why anyone watches that guys shit... I think I made it through about 3mins of one review... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @passthemstickss Hey... at least you got a house... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis There's a sequel to QUBE for VR too... like to see stuff like that and Talos on VR. FPP (First Person Puzzlers) should work. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis I was talking on top of the stuff you listed... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Adrift, and Battlezone for me. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Earned 1 PS4 trophy (1 bronze) in Borderlands 2 - https://t.co/p4uUPiZ39W <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis ...I think they're actually implementing 1st Person Mode... some fighter tried it before. It wasn't very good. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Tekken 7 on VR still makes no sense... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> What happens when Koei's missed the boat, and it's a Back to the Future Musou...? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GuerrillaDawg Can't have a Musou where all the main characters die... sry Dawg <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Cool. Site breaks embargo on NFS review. Lists poor handling and lack of customization in the negatives... Not sure they played the game. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 Nintendo is going 3rd party, and integrating the eShop w/the PSN, XBL, and the iOS App store. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @passthemstickss A lot of these porting studios probably aren't paid enough to have a lot of pride in their work <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @johnnydork ...are you a master debater? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Justinator5000 Assuming NFS...Beta worked pretty well. It is sort of pointless though. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Looking to start reading some manga again, but hopefully on iPad, with minimal investment... any suggestions? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NintendoTweet I'm not even at work for Monday yet lol <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Is it Friday yet? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I was super resistant to re-buying Talos Principle, because of the price... but I'm glad I did. I'll probably never play my PC again. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> #PS4share https://t.co/bpJAFJvfpE <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @SuperNintendad single player for sure... but the trailer made me want to try MP out, which is a big step for me. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> broke down and bought Talos... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Joesff Just throw those 2 on repeat... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis true story <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Which character is Nintendo's worst? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Joesff good guess lol <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Joesff 2 of those bands don't count... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Some people have really shitty taste in vidya gaem characters. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis people being stupid, because they're stupid <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm ready for NFS and BLOPSIII to unlock...I'm sure with my luck, Fallout 4 will pre-load early too. Just to torture me. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Cool. Nothing that I haven't paid for, or isn't free via PS+ coming this week. Might buy Talos Principle after all. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch @PranooYY I just want Japan to start porting the visual novel games to iOS...literally no reason not to. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @PranooYY @ETDragonPunch I have the Majora system. Feels super cheap. The nub is pretty worthless, since nothing really uses it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch @PranooYY I don't know. Probably going to sell the thing (assuming the wife will let me). All I play is Picross. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch @PranooYY I'm real salty about the 3DS tbh. Fucking hate myself for buying a *new* 3DS because it's a worthless PoS lol <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch @PranooYY @LeafyCam nah, most of those games will go to mobile... assuming they're from Japan. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @PranooYY @ETDragonPunch Library is pretty awful IMO. At least compared to the DS (or GBA). <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch really? Even after the bullshit library the 3DS has? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ...I still don't know why the hell I pre-paid for Old Hunters... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I've, to varying degrees, barely played most peoples GotY titles... yet here I am, sitting and playing Borderlands 2. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 probably the later... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Trade-in Value on my new 3DS XL is sitting at $100 in the US... curious what it'll be up here. Might venture over and see. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch *not a sex offender <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Cool GAF is being shit again. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GuerrillaDawg shame about the stick layout though... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> well...good job me... I've hyped myself up to buy Playstation VR. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ...and it ran like a flipbook in portion where things actually happened. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Witcher 3 is actually an ugly game with nice standing character models... But people get too drawn into that shit. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Looks at Fallout 4 screenshots. Looks at in game Witcher 3 graphics. Nope. Don't really see a huge difference. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Destiny, BLOPSIII, and [redacted] from Bethesda were all perfectly fine during their tests though. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Not sure what the deal is, but the last 2 games from 2K that I played in beta, the matchmaking on PS4 was super broken. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Resogun and Jamestown+ are the closest things I can thing of on current gen... at least out of the ones that are any good. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheFrugster not really. SHMUPs are usually Horizontal or Vertical movement. I guess Resogun is close to one... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Playing Bug Princess (1 &amp; 2) on my iPad makes me wish that SHMUPs were a viable genre in NA. Can't think of any available on new gen... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Really wish the matchmaking was working properly in this beta. I really do like the game... even when we get rolled. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Totally forgot that I'll likely have my tax return prior to Playstation VR releasing... looks like I might be able to get it day 1. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GuerrillaDawg what is that? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Spent all day cleaning, reading baby stuff and buying Mountain Dew. Come back to see people upset about Fallout 4s graphics. Ok <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Earned 6 PSN trophies (2 bronze, 3 silver and 1 gold) in 2 games - https://t.co/p4uUPiZ39W <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The Mountain Dew case came with a code for 2x XP in a mode I never ever play. Lol <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I bought Black Ops 3 themed Mountain Dew. Because why the fuck wouldn't I. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @PranooYY (you should see how doom looks right now) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @PranooYY It's a Bethesda game. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm one of the people that don't like Halloween. Largely because I tend not to like other peoples kids. (because they're kids are assholes) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ...these queue times... FFS. I've easily spent 6-8hrs in queue, and only managed to get into ~7 matches <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 ...I beat all 3 in like a week... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> #ねこあつめ https://t.co/y5S39CSpPF <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Maybe I should start making some Minecraft Let's Plays... or alternatively, I could bathe in battery acid. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Wtf am i doing with my life #PS4share https://t.co/BqgucpZ7ik <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Guy named assshampoo on my team. Big surprise... he's terrible. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis New game from the people that did Gone Home. Dafuq Dennis... srsly <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis I'm always scared of that lol. Still not thrilled that Tacoma is first on Xbone. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheFrugster I played the beta. Game is good. FMV stuff is hilariously bad. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Prolly gonna announce console beta at Blizz-con. Just hoping it's not Xbone first/exclusive. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Overwatch looks kinda dull... Was watching some shitty streamers. I want to try it... but I don't want to play on PC. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis lol It's not shitty :} And the matchmaking on PS4 is super busted. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Eventually, yes. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Resisting the urge to buy more games. NFS and BLOPSIII unlock this coming week. Need to save the 💰 for pre-orders <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Don't know what to play now... Sort of want to get the PS4 version of Talos Principle. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis lol I don't actually. Just like the "beat the game" trophies for the sake of having them. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis :| Man... beating games is the only reason I have half the trophies I do. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> :| Nova-111 doesn't have a trophy for beating the game... oh well. 51 on the year. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GuerrillaDawg dont do it dawg...save the money for milkbones or something... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch timdog already block too? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> As expected, the reactions to the PS+ line up is glorious. https://t.co/8GbiNqN0Ik <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 *insert comment about playing to many weeb games* <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I can only assume that either Sony doesn't care, because they'll still sell more copies, or the conversion rate on those demos isn't good. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Sorta funny that the EA/Sony cross promo stuff is all available first on Xbone through EA Access. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> One of these days, Phil will have the sense to get rid of Greenberg, and I won't have anyone at Xbox to make fun of anymore. <Text_End>

https://… <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @johnnydork Lol nice try... You are not the Dorito Pope. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 Sorry... Meowser isn't canon. Nintendo is retconning 3D World from the vast array of Mario bros lore. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Making some adjustments/updates to my GOTY list. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @johnnydork Dragon Fin Soup looks promising... Assuming you don't hate Mystery Dungeon style games... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> https://t.co/Yn23hvUCdw <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Is your taste in video games shit? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> How is No Man's Sky delayed when it was never given a formal release date... just a loose target of 2015? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @PranooYY #digitalmasterrace lol Almost all the digital games come with themes. Most are shit. Bloodbowl 2, I got a theme instead of a team. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @PranooYY Came with The Handsome Collection. Has great music. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> CoD hype #PS4share https://t.co/1Ffb32e7EC <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @johnnydork not to say the game isn't having issues... I just doubt there's a reliable source giving info for a studio that small. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @johnnydork He just echos whatever the community wants to hear. People need a new game to shit on...NMS will be it, until June. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @johnnydork It's a shit source... someone from Destructoid. And I generally don't trust anything that's associated with Sterling. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @johnnydork Oh... that sure is a reliable source... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @johnnydork Says who? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @PlayStation: Twisted roguelike RPG Dragon Fin Soup launches Tuesday, and it's free for PS Plus members: https://t.co/l7poyKkHey https:/… <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> these queues are harsh... nothing like waiting an hour for a match, and have the matchmaking break. :| <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @PranooYY BB was an early 2015 title. Those games get forgotten. Look at Dying Light (which was great, minus the awful end boss) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> MGSV is the only fully playable Metal Gear. I'm fine with it winning awards. It deserves it for fixing that franchises biggest flaw. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @PranooYY yeah, neither of those games reviewed better than MGSV... and I'd rather not see Witcher win anything. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @PranooYY What were the other options? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @passthemstickss No interestin Dragon Fin Soup? Indie tactical RPG...Or is the rogue-like stuff a prob? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Ori was mechanically flawed, and had really poor "trial and error" level design throughout. How is that the best Xbox One game... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @PranooYY I know... I just don't know who voted for that game. It was really poorly designed. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @PranooYY ...wut... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Dragon Fin Soup is a PS+ game... nice. (Vita/PS4 cross buy) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @passthemstickss The official blog post isn't up yet, just the YT vid. I assume they won't list the PS3/Vita games anyway... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> UK PSN Store can preorder Alienation, Shadow of the Beast, and This War of Mine. Why aren't these available in NA @PlayStation? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 Netflix Canada is getting it next year... I'll get to watch it then <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> My favorite thing in the world is that everyone shits on Knack and KZ Shadowfall, but it's the first game they ask for as a PS+ title. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ...also need a club... or for someone to join the one I made. Neither of those things will happen though <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Looking forward to the Driveclub updates. I'm bad at the game... need those brake assists :) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> NFS has it's second update. Game isn't released officially yet. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> (Likely because the devs of Helldivers made the first Magicka) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Both PS4 PS+ titles this month are solid games. Magicka 2 got overlooked because it released so close to Helldivers, and was very similar. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 thought the story arc was more interesting in general. S1 had a couple dull episodes. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 Game. Show's awful. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Unpopular opinion; Walking Dead S2 was better than S1. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Heh... PS+ games confirmed on PS4. Comments are gonna be great. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 I think most games bitch about games to be edgy. It's why I do it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 At least he has personality though... Even Daisy is better than Mario... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 Mario has no personality though... he's basically Nintendo's least interesting character <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Wife seems oddly accepting of the fact that I'm considering buying Playstation VR, depending on date and price. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 @fourhman New Super Mario Bros was a mistake. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 The correct answer is Toad. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Super excited for that, and all the edgy comments bitching about free games that goes with it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The only way the comment sections of articles could get more hilarious today, is if Sony announces the PS+ line up for Nov. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Sorry... claim to boycott... since most were never going to buy it in the first place. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Curious how many gross weeb Nintendoyearolds are going boycott Xenoblade X now that it's had the pedo-outfits removed (or censored) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It's like saying the best part of Uncharted was the stealth mechanics... or the best part of a Platinum game is the environment. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Halo is great for it's mechanics, encounter, and level design. GTFO with this shit about it's story and characters being "great" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ...It's a Walmart brand Warhammer 40k knock. I'm sure 99% of the Halo "fans" out there haven't read a single C-tier Halo Novel. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I can't eyeroll hard enough when people start talking about the "lore" of the Halo universe, and how great it is... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Oh well... Sold my Vita months and months ago. So it's not really my problem. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It's nice to see Vita getting games, but it's hard to be happy for the poor thing when it's shit like Civ Rev 2. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Vita gettin' a port of a mediocre mobile Civ game. awesome. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis honestly, someone needs to keep all the perv-y weebs and their anime avatars in check. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis I'd have less of an issue with her if she didn't play on ignorance, and cut scenes for the purpose of her narrative. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis why... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Working on setting up a place for the PS4 on the big TV again...
Also need to figure out how I'm going to move the Wii U up to our bedroom. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis 2 Heart Attacks in a single match.... Is that the Gearbox effect or something... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> TFW a 5v4 match turns to a 2v4 match because of a disconnect and 2 inactive people. Why bother playing a beta if you're going to AFK? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> these matchmaking queues are rough... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis https://t.co/7BrBm5HeFx <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Da feed <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Playing Moba style games w/randoms... gud timez lol <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Game is great. Significantly less bs than in normal mobas. At least in the mode in the beta. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis MMMMOOOOOOBBBBBAAAAA <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Was gonna go to bed early... but I'm working from home tomorrow... and I'd like to play a bit more of this beta tonight... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> LOLOLOLOL Stella Glow for 3DS is $67.09 CAD on the eShop... and that's before tax. Fucking Atlus weeb games. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> FYI #PS4share https://t.co/pCcTbqmDAW <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> .@TheWordofRawr bought... not could.... not sure wtf happened with my typing there. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> For reasons unknown (or because there's no fucking chance I'll buy another Souls game post BB), I could The Old Hunters DLC. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> These queue times... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis or you know... not bitching about games that are free (or technically cost basically nothing) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> As expected, people are preemptively pissing and moaning about next months possible PS+ line up. I, for one, am shocked. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Game under NDA... posts to my PS4 timeline. Gud timez. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Pro Tip: Don't play gimmick support in the first public beta of a game... it doesn't go too well <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> MOOOOOBBBBBAAAAAA <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> yay... a beta I actually enjoy... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> 29 assists and a dominating victory. God Tier support is God Tier. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch rule of the internet; You can't please any of the people, any of the time. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AlphaFoxWarfare @johnnydork So Canada is shit then... Oh well :| <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @johnnydork @AlphaFoxWarfare Looks like EU only right now... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch Used to be late Nov... every year it creeps further and further into the year. Years of retail made me sort of hate Xmas. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch Local Loblaw's already fucking has christmas shit out... right beside the Halloween stuff... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Pretty salty about the Mirror's Edge delay, but I guess it gives me more dedicated SFV time. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis 0 chance I'll buy a Far Cry game again. Might give Deus Ex a try...first one was a solid 7/10 game. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis well... Far Cry 4 was trash, and the last Deus Ex wasn't very good. Pretty safe bet than they won't be great. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis except the 2 shit ones that are still releasing on that day. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Awesome... the only good game out of the 3 releasing on the 23rd of Feb is delayed. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis lol <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Been in EA on Steam for quite some time. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Looks like at one point the PlayOverwatch site actually flat out said it was coming to PC and Consoles. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @johnnydork Sry... Axiom Verge is my GotY. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @PranooYY Score. Although I've watched some stream footage... and it looks sort of "meh". Want to try it though. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @PranooYY wut <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @johnnydork nah. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis yup. just fuckheads blowing stuff up and screaming like idiots. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis SE gave God Mode demos out to trash YTers a month or so back. Gud timez. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @mmalex: Dave is really pissed off with me for all the 'vr confirmed' angles but hey Dave it would b cool and you're not on Twitter so: … <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @johnnydork I choked on my drink when I read "THE RICHNESS OF THE UNIVERSE AND THE STORY" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I really hope the PS+ leak is accurate. Not because I don't own those games... but because of the salt. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis I'm started to "buy in" to the idea. Not sure if I'll be able to get one at launch though... depends on the price. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Almost no one was excited to make games for Kinect/Wii/Move. Fewer people were excited to play them. VR seems to be trending differently. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Feel like there are a lot more developers "on board" and excited for VR, versus the motion control fad. Next few years will be interesting. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis https://t.co/7zqHljcOnZ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis https://t.co/f7HWgLlXkl <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis sure... but the trailer did nothing to create interest in the game. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis I liked the Detroit trailer. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis It's ok to be wrong sometimes... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Earned 23 PS4 trophies (13 bronze, 7 silver, 2 gold and 1 platinum) in 2 games - https://t.co/p4uUPiZ39W <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Probably get an PC port. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @hanmik01 until? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis fuckers didn't re-edit the trailer when they put it on the NA YT channel. Might just not be up yet. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis I have poops with better art style and story than the average Plat game... so obviously yeah.  Want to hear more though. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Shadow of the Beast trailer says it's available for pre-order. It's not. At least not on the NA store. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis I'm interested, seeing the proper res trailer. Still... just looks like more Bayonetta clone stuff from Plat. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis No clue. Did they even show all the games that they had demo-ing at the pre-show? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheFrugster First time a free game has ever been a deterrence to buy a console. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @passthemstickss lol... white people. :} <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheFrugster Why? It's to stop people from being assholes, and then hiding behind a new ID. It should be locked, or pay-walled. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheFrugster Why shouldn't you have to? It's a paid service on Xbox Live. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> When you sign up for a service as XxXfukboi777XxX you should have to live with that shit for ever. They should tattoo it on your face. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I hope Sony never lets you change your PSN name. People should have to live with shitty decisions. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NintendoTweet Not many people cared when Gravity Rush came to Vita. I expect it to be like Tearaway, where people will pass on it anyway. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Oh well... I'm hoping I enjoy [redacted] because I was watching some Overwatch, and it looks kinda "meh". <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Having a publicly advertised beta, and putting a NDA on it just seems silly to me... given that stuff will leak anyway. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> [redacted] is under NDA over the beta this weekend, which sort of sucks, since it's a closed public beta... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 I had OG DCs, so there was no mods. lol I just pirated everything. I used to have a bunch of unreleased games. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 Great, diverse line up. Something you can't say about a lot of consoles anymore unfortunately. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 Shame it's library isn't nearly as good as the DCs :| Dreamcast really deserved better... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> awesome... looks like EU broke street date on NFS. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @wlatham92 Battlefront was mostly hoping that they release some cool planets and heroes... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @wlatham92 understand completely. I won't be buying CoD or BF next year, so i was willing to spend the $$ on the passes. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @wlatham92 The interesting thing, will be if the PSN adjusts the individual packs properly... which they generally don't for stuff &lt;$20 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @wlatham92 FPS map packs have been like this for years. 4x $15 or pass for $50. Price is fair given the work required for maps. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @wlatham92 I did the exchange conversion... it should cost ~$65. Retail games are $80 tax here remember...3DS games are $50-$60 lol <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @wlatham92 DLC hadn't been effected by the shitty CAD up until then. I bought early, so it was only $50 for me. I'm terrible, but I saved $$ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> NVM on PS+ announcement... sounds like Sony might have run into issues securing the games (again). Oh well... I was looking forward to salt. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> EA charging $70 for the Battlefront Season Pass, is only about a $5 over charge...(I bought it at $50 CAD anyway) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Looking at the current CAD exchange rates, we're actually only getting gouged by about a dollar now w/our $80 new releases. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Not even the good 2.0 starter pack either... it's the one with Stitch and Merida <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ...Disney Infinity 2.0 &amp; Gears Remastered Bundle on sale at BB Canada. Who thought that bundle through... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 Yeah, but why lock to the hardware in the first place. They're literally the only ones doing that shit. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ...Apparently the new Nintendo account system doesn't seem to indicate that Nintendo is stopping their hardware DRM. Fun. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @passthemstickss I actually want to try Warzone... I want to see what the big deal is/wtf it is. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Seriously don't understand why people post derp-y shit like "I don't know why games launch digital only". <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Digital also gives publishers greater control of pricing, and cuts down distribution/middle-man costs. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Companies are pushing digital because it means you can't trade the product in, meaning no lost sales. Not that hard to understand. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> "Seriously, what the hell is it with NoA &amp; SCEA constantly trying to foist digital releases and/or rewards onto their respective customers" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> "crap compared to nothing is still crap. And North America’s Club Nintendo program was always kinda crap" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Man... comments on some of the Nintendo account system articles are hilarious. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 we'll see. Baby doesn't do much other than sleep, eat, and poop for the first year or so. gotta start training him for MLG tho. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @wlatham92 Lot of indies feel that way. At least Blow as been pretty quiet about it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> My wife, who hasn't been off work since our honeymoon (10yrs ago) is less than 10 days from the start of mat leave. Should be interesting. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> So PS+ games should be announced either later today, or tomorrow... In theory. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 Everything, for every current gen system has got the same type of shit posting. 3DS isn't special in that regard. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 It's because the library has been largely disappointing in comparison to the DS. And the new Zelda/Metroid are filler titles. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Anyway... final sportsing tweet; Raptors won their season opener. Barely. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Jays routinely underperformed, mortgaged a lot of their future, all to build a team that would win now... or not. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> lol Jays "fans" who don't follow the sport at all are upset that Anthopoulos isn't coming back. He's been GM for 6yrs guys... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Also... Monthly reminder that Vanquish isn't anywhere near as good as nerds say it is. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Well... actually... the environments look less trash than most Plat games, but if the gameplay is basically Bayonetta, again, why bother. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Nier just looks like another Platinum game... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @hanmik01 Gonna assume that it's going to be something for the non-japan Asian territories... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Reading through the Nintendo Account stuff feels like I was transported back in time to 2008. Also... that mobile thing... LULZ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch so did the Order. Gears was the same shit though. Same shitty boss fights too. If Order had MP, they would have been the same <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch true... this one is about 4 mths from launch (Battleborn) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch Well.. they're making more Gears... and it's the same shit basically. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> TFW you've played so many alphas/betas that you forget to check in the new ones you're in are under NDA... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch I needed a new stick anyway... the SG drivers are sketchy AF on PS4. Needed a native stick <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Chun TE2 is sort of gross. Glad I bought the blue &amp; black... even if the plexi is shit. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Waiting for BLOPSIII. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> TFW you own all the games, and can't figure out what to play because of that... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ...then I'll just stop playing games...and start posting on GAF. I should fit in better then... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> 10yrs in the "tech" fields have ruined whatever enjoyment I used to get out of PCs. I'm a console peasant... until consoles die. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'd be a lot more interested in Overwatch if it wasn't PC only... really don't enjoy playing games on PC anymore. Rather just not play. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Characters, and interactions are good though... and it is geared more towards the Minecraft target demo (kids) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Finished Ep2 of Story Mode. It was decent. Gameplay is still pretty minimal, even for a TT game. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis well...yeah <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis not how the community works... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis I'm sort of shocked it hasn't happened. Sony folks were all over that shit at the first gameplay reveal. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 I'm not down for the new mini-series that's linked to the show... Liked the original characters. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Time to finish up a bit of work... then make a coffee, and play Ep 2 of Minecraft Story Mode. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Anywho... I highly recommend Tales from the Borderlands. It's probably Telltale's best work. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis The only thing I hate more than trophy hunting is amiibo. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ...I have 3 Platinums... and they're all basically handouts from Telltale games. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> 50 games in 2015... not 50 plats... not even fucking close on that one... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> That's 50.
Tales from the Borderlands

<Text_Begin> @TheFrugster they complain about the games that are all the same.... but then complain about the ones that do things differently. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheFrugster Heavy Rain was fine, and was a bit overrated. Didn't play Beyond. Issue is more that people just hate everything. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Lotta Cage hate. Lotta Media Molecule hate. Lotta people need their games to always be the same damn thing. It's a shame. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheFrugster I just don't think I've ever heard you mention a game that you liked... it's why I asked. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheFrugster lol Do you actually like any games? like at all? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @unravel_game: Unravel is available for digital pre-order on PlayStation 4: https://t.co/F9SKsuoTx4 https://t.co/7HMfybEHor <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @johnnydork It's actually pretty good... assuming you a) have a decent group to play with, and b) can deal with a bit of jankiness. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 nintendo is flooding the market, and the amiibo bubble will pop. Be nice if they had something to fall back on. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 We'll see. DeNA is a weak partner, but it was low risk for Nintendo. My issue is with people that buy amiibo over games or hw. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 Saying Nintendo vs Sony (or MS) as a whole, makes no sense, since those companies are more diverse entities. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 Not really. I'm just saying that Sony is a much bigger company, with much bigger issues. Same for Microsoft. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 I'm guessing that means that every Nintendo fan bought about 100k amiibo. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 To be fair, Playstation is making a profit. Sony as a whole isn't. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 They aren't exactly rolling in yearly profits...although I'm sure the low cost amiibo help when they aren't making games :} <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Imagine if all those Nintendo fans spent money on Nintendo games, and consoles, rather than amiibo. Just imagine... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @browland1 Probably the same articles that came up after the last one, although MS investment might soften the sales reqs. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @victoredfield True, but nothing on the list is 100% confirmed for 2016, other than Rise of the Tomb Raider on PS4. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 Sure it is. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> 2016 (unpaid) list is;
Horizon
dreams
TLG
RotTR
ME Andromeda
Detroit
6 others are already paid. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The possibility of me buying PSVR next year is pretty small, but I'd like to not over commit myself to 2016 titles I want... just in case. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 I really love P4G, but I never make it past the 20hr mark or so... I just lose interest, and move on to something else. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 Xenoblade is probably one of the most disappointing games I've played. My fault for trusting Nintendo fans I guess lol <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 Admittedly, I tire of almost any game after about 20 or so hours... so that would be nice. Don't have time for the grind. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I get bored by JRPGs after 15-20hrs. Buying an 80+ hour one doesn't really make any sense. Gotta stop doing that shit. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Something I never thought I'd say; I'm dropping P5 off my 2016 games list... in favor of a David Cage game. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @PranooYY analysis is likely short term. Oculus wins the long game 9 times out of 10 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @PranooYY Basically $400+$400 is more accessible than $1300+$400. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @PranooYY Oculus' issue is that most people don't have a PC that can run the Oculus. It's essentially enthusiast only at launch. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @PranooYY Been saying that for a while. It's got the lowest barrier of entry (as far as cost), and a known property backing it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Honestly nice to hear that 343 got their shit together, and Halo 5's MP actually works properly. Industry needs less MCCs &amp; DC launches. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> GT is GT, and is like a tranq dart to the brain for me. I lost interest in that series almost a decade ago. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I think UC4 MP looks good, and I don't like the old UC MP.
And I'm interested in Cage's bullshit...even though I don't like Heavy Rain. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Watched the PGW trailers properly. Sold on 2 of 3 things I general don't like. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Also, still a little shocked NFS preloaded already. PS4 preloads are usually the Sunday before launch. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> finished Ep3 of Tales from the Borderlands...Probably finish it the series tomorrow. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> lol The Unravel "theme" is literally just the box art they've shown. So many pre-order themes are terrible. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Pretty sure Old Hunters pre-pays will go up today... it shows up in coming soon, but the link goes no where. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Flunkie @ItsameDennis Helldivers was great... also, very different games. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Of course... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Ok #PS4share https://t.co/T3mZ2lIysi <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'd argue that some series... Like Fire Emblem or Advance Wars, would be better on mobile. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Nintendo specializes in simplistic gameplay loops that are entertaining in short bursts. No reason they can't do that on mobile. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Honestly, I'm more interested in Nintendo's mobile announcement, than anything they've done in the past year. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @amoFTX yup <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Need to make a list of the smaller games I plan to buy... Stuff like Firewatch, Shadow of the Beast, etc. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis not up on the Soony NA store yet. It'll be $20 here too... Like Unravel <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis nice. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis well... As much as it costs now. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis I bought Driveclub Bikes, Minecraft Story Mode Ep2, and Unravel. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis https://t.co/YTxMJafy0w <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Bikes + Story Mode Ep2 + Unravel. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @browland1 Both sides are behaving poorly. It's sort of amusing that people act like PS4 have 0 games because it lacks a Halo-like exclusive <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> NA Gaemz media is really trying to push that whole "PS4 haz no gaemz" vs "Xbone haz all da gaemz" narrative. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Rise of the Tomb Raider is the only fall Xbox One game I wanted, and I won't have time til next yr to play it anyway, so I'll wait. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Given the choice between no games, or Halo 5... I'd take no games. Of course that would only be valid if PS4 had no games. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Mine was actually finding out what dreams was... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Missed the end of the show because of work related silliness. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Sort of shocked to see Sony pushing it so hard... it's a good sign though. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> WiLD <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> GT being a PSVR title is as surprising as the community shitting on this conference. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> GT Sport sounds cool, it's not my thing though <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 I'm not ruling it out completely til I try it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Sony doing good work with PSVR. They have a way to go to convince people this isn't another Wii or Kinect. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It's a puzzle game with creation functions. It looks great. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> People are acting exactly as I expected. Gamers are everything that's wrong with gaming. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> UC4 MP looks interesting. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @passthemstickss But you're getting Tomb Raider? The TR reboot was basically an Uncharted game lol <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> lotta folks have awful taste in a vidya gaemz. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @johnnydork fite me <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> How exactly do you delay a game w/o a firm release date? https://t.co/QQ5q7SwcHQ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> R&amp;C still being the best looking current gen game. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Matterfall is probably a spiritual successor to Outland. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheFrugster Yes. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Just give me Thumper. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> wubwub <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Tekken 7 mutha fuckers <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> lol <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ...if you hate Ono... you're an awful person. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> man... 'Sim looks good. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I really loved that game...*insert fuck the haters comment* <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ...man... Who ever is making the Battlefront trailers needs an epic raise. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @passthemstickss I'm at work... but I'm listening to the twitch stream... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> This music is pretty much the worst... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Who ever is doing this mix needs to die in a fire. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis You mean the streams BS music, or the real audio? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Yup. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 Too Human was 360... (and developed by a studio that was down the street from my childhood home) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 Xbox 1 was the best box. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> So Edith Fitch is basically a crazy as trip... I'm down. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 I didn't get a PS2 until PS360 were already out... I was an Xbot/Nintendoyearold back then <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Gimme Shadow of the Beast. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 ah. I've never played Ico, and only about 15-20mins of SotC <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 TLG, or FF7? Have you played either of the other Team Ico games? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis I'm just saying I wouldn't be surprised if it was a more pure driving simulator... or had open road options. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 I'll get TLG, but that's really it <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 A little over hyped to be honest. FF7 is years off, Shemnue 3 is a dream of people that didn't play the first 2... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis You know it's probably going to happen, right? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> People really legit think that NMS is gonna release today... nah... it'll be a PS+ game in November :} <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 Oh yeah... :| Last E3 was real bad. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 E3 must be disappointing for you too though, it is not? It's almost all western AAA <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Oh...cool... I guess I get a Yarny theme. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Tekken 7 PS4 incoming... me thinks. https://t.co/4eooNzXMPx <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> https://t.co/dbHDaRlGdF <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Joesff I wasn't a Genesis kid... sorry. Also... Big is the best Sonic friend. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis nice. Probably be $20 CAD here. I'll get it at that price for sure... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Thankfully my copies of Mirrors Edge, and SFV are paid. Firewatch is the only sure bet for me. Unravel depends on price. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Joesff And Sonic games are still bad... Somethings never change. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Serious? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Do they still even make music? Lead singer was a pretentious asshat... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis As in the shit Nu Metal band? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 It's good. Very classic style. It's more "casual" friendly, because there's fewer gimmicks. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Capcom probably doesn't care too much about the competition. Fighters sell to different people. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Feb is the new November. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Earlier than I expected. https://t.co/GyG7cGPEIQ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Not saying that every indie is great, but a lot are, and do things that AAA can't anymore. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I wish "gamers" could have a more open mind to games. Having a publisher doesn't equal quality. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Why are people shitting on indie devs today? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Or good people. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 not at all...Which is why I didn't buy the game. Only real draw for me would be challenging Mario levels. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 I'm trying to debunk the whole "Canadians are nice people" thing. I'm only trolling you half the time... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 But if you wanted easy Mario levels, why wouldn't you just play the Nintendo made Mario games. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Shitposting on an article is like walking into someones home and shitting on their floor. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 Sort of defeats the purpose of Mario Maker does it not. I thought the draw was having people make actually challenging levels? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It's like the PSBlog posts that are "I hate indie games, so I wanted to tell you, indie dev, that what you make is shit. Won't buy" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> "I don't actually care about what you posted, but I wanted to take the time to comment and tell you that I didn't." https://t.co/FX54GCyLNn <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Always feel bad for devs when Marketing folks fuck up and release stuff before they're supposed to. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Sony will be announcing the PS+ Games for November soon... wonder if they'll do "big" games, and announce it at PGW. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis "I love all you guys... as long as you're paying me... 'cause this is sub only chat" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @fourhman I suspect that the series was done all in advance. Probably part of the deal to make the game...(hopefully) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Make sure to like, subscribe, share, and go to my Patreon <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Self-entitlement of the younger generation is disgusting. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis That too. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Dear Youtubers; If Youtube is such a raw deal, go self-host your videos. Manage your own site, content and analytics. Otherwise, STFU. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> "Content Creators" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis https://t.co/hCloH3ndsH <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @passthemstickss How does cable have some many issues? I had cable up here for years, with basically everything. Never had a prob. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Vidya Gaemz. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @fourhman That's shocking.... :| <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis well, yeah... Especially people with anime avatars. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis It's a shitty system, but most people are too shit to read, and just want validation for their purchases. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis People want a properly 1500 word critique of a game boiled down into a rating. Just like they want/expect it for movies. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Just a reminder... this is still coming next year #Indiestation4  https://t.co/2alT0wR8OB via @YouTube <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I really enjoyed Ep1. I'm still not sure who Minecraft Story Mode is for though, outside of adults who happen to like Minecraft &amp; Telltale. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Telltale is pushing out the Minecraft episodes pretty fast... wonder if it was part of the deal... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 For you? Probably not. EU shows are generally focused on EU devs and indie art house games. You can probably pass. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 :} Srsly though...if you can ever get a PS3 on the cheap... you should play Ni No Kuni. Probably the best console JRPG last gen <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 You're a terrible person. You played pretty much the worst game from last gen, and then sold the best console. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Why can't we grade games properly...5/10 should be an average game. Right now, people think that about 8/10s. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 You never played Ni No Kuni did you? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Looking like Halo 5 will settle somewhere around the low 80s. Clearly, it's the worst game of this generation. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> PGW presser in about 4.5hrs if I'm not mistaken. 
Really hope it's indie focused liked the GC pressers were. The salt will be glorious. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Pubbed by Square, dev'ed by Platinum. That's gross. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Someone needs to be. I'm the voice of reason in this community. Everything is shit (unless it's pubbed by Sony or Indie) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis It's ok... I'm sure it will suit the game by the time it launches. :} <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Very difficult for small devs to build and release a fully functional online focused game. You really only get 1 shot in that market... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Unsurprisin. to read that Secret Ponchos didn't really achieve success on consoles. Great game, but almost unplayable at launch. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @Yoshi_OnoChin: We're making preparation for ... ;P #PGW https://t.co/8glab9LfnY <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Seems likely that Ono is revealing 'Sim today at PGW. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @don_raul: @NoMansSky Take your time to aim. Fighting against the clock ourselves; nobody will care how long it took to make. Only if it… <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> (Which is fine, since I find most of the AAA game space to be uninspired) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Glad I own the Indiestation 4... Because Indies are going to make up the bulk of my purchases in 2016 baring a recovery of the CAD. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Video gaming in Canada is quickly becoming cost prohibitive. $50-$80 dollars, plus taxes, just for a single new game (platform dependant). <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> On top of everything else, Canadians should really thank our departing PM for making our dollar worth about as much as Canadian Tire money. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It's not that the increase isn't warranted, given the current exchange rate... it's just a "tipping point" issue. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> lol @ EA for upping the price of the Battlefront Season Pass for Canadians. Good Luck w/that. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch lolwow. Glad I paid for mine already... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch ...yes. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I see this shit all the time. Dumb upper middle class white folk with a chip on their shoulder, and trying to be "gangsta" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Like seriously... White people, you can listen to hip hop and not be a fucking retard about it. That shitty tattoo won't get you street cred <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Dumb white kid on the bus, thinking he's Gucci with a bullshit ice cream cone tattooed on his face. Fuckin' white people man... (I'm white) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 they've been on a consistent decline since the NES, with the Wii being an exception. They haven't handled competition well. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 they need to do more though, and be quicker about it. Nintendo isn't a very agile company. They operate like its the SNES era. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 I don't doubt it, but why doesn't Nintendo work with pubs to get this stuff here... Not like their consoles are flooded... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 ...well Atlus and Capcom..to be fair. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 Atlus, who likely aren't  profitable, are the only real bright spot for the 3DS <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 Nintendo should have been pushing SE to localize. It's just like its insane Yokai took almost 3 yrs to come here. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 honestly, Nintendo is as much to blame as Square is. They don't give a fuck about NA or EU as territories. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 most people (based on the internet) thought that buying BD would influence Square, which it clearly didn't. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I brought my 3DS with me. I'm not sure why. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Is it Friday yet? Pls. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 how many people just bought BD thinking it would me more localizations? Game wasn't very good... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 last time I checked, goodwill doesn't pay the bills. And not localizing everything makes people appreciate what they get more. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 I actually have DQV. Port plays well enough for a mobile title. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 honestly, the DQ mobile ports aren't bad. It's the FF remake abominations that Square got a bad rap for. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 at least not with the 3DS player base size, and tastes. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 Seriously though, SE is a business, and one looking for specific profit margins. DQ in NA won't drive profits for them <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 "cash grabs" is a capitalist 'murica thing... like freedom. You should love it :) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 That doesn't make any sense... if they were cocky, they'd localize everything... because they'd see guaranteed success. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 11 will get localized on PS4, because Sony will probably fork cash out to make it happen... so just be happy about that lol. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 Sure they do. As I said, 5-10% sale projected bump probably isn't worth the expense/risk. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> 8 day playtest in early Nov... if I wasn't about to take vacation, I'd probably have taken it and gone (it's a $600 gift card if you do) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 *shrug* SE clearly has reason not to have faith in DQ outside of Japan. I wouldn't localize for a 5-10% sales boost. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 Bravely Default only sold a bit over 400k... and that was hyped as an OG FF. Most people don't really love DQ as much. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 Maybe, but they'd expect a third of those numbers for a localized 3DS iteration. Likely not enough to cover localization. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 I want to buy a Xbox One and Destiny just because of that tweet.... :} <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @arrayoob I don't really dislike Halo... it's not my cup of tea anymore... but even when I was a fan, it was for MP, and MP only. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 keep in mind, when DQ9 released, there were 50mil DS's sold in the US...3DS isn't even at half that right now. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 probably, but Musou titles cost almost nothing to localize. They usually don't even redub them. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @arrayoob Story-wise? nah... it's why I wasn't surprised when Destiny's writing was garbage. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 DQ9 only sold about 600k copies in the US. (about 10% of the global total as per always reliable VGChartz). <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 People still underestimate the cost of localizing a game like DQ... it's not like the series succeeded in the past here. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch For some of us, it never mattered <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Srsly guys...Halo's narrative has been hot trash since day one... stop pretending like it was ever a glorious space opera (or some shit) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @PranooYY WelcometoGAF.gif <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @PranooYY Think gaf is too busy shit postings in the review thread. Gotta cry about that 85 after all. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @PranooYY As in Ben's story? Or did they shitpost something else? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Polygon giving a first party MS title a good score is about as surprising as waking up to a blue sky. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @PranooYY lol You can enjoy a bad story... I just don't think that would be a reason to not play Halo... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @PranooYY Halo's story has always been awful. It was a game about mechanics and encounter design. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @browland1 No MP focused game should ever be reviewed before launch. Single Player games are fine though. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @browland1 Yeah. My issue is less with the "review in progress" and more with the sites giving scores before launch. Shit needs to stop. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Stealth___  Ubi's stance has always been that the market was there for the titles. Curious to see if AC is still profitable after an off yr <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 No, but Yo-kai (and eventual X) failure  could make Nintendo question localizing other titles <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @browland1 Halo 5s embargo should be 2-3 days post release... at a minimum. Same with things like CoD, etc. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @browland1 Well.. .the issue is that b-tier sites are releasing review scores for online-centric games w/o being on live servers... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 (It probably will) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @browland1 They could apologize a whole bunch until it gets super irritating. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheFrugster Wired connection helps. Otherwise, there's not much you can do without fiddling with your network config. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @PlayStation: In 24 hours, watch the PlayStation press conference broadcast live from Paris. Full details: https://t.co/45rfm84B9d https… <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 Last real midnight launch I did was PS4. I just happened to be up this week when Syndicate unlocked though... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis PC Gamers are a mistake. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis This is why PC gamers can't have nice things... only shitty ports of console games. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The full classic roster will come eventually, as will a bunch of characters from SFIV. The issue is that Capcom keeps ignoring SFIII <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> lol so Juri and Ibuki were datamined from the PC beta for SFV. I'm fine with that. I'm shit with everyone anyway. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> As a grown ass adult, I need to look at consoles for the sum of the content, not a single "must have" title. "Must have" is just hype anyway <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> My big take away from this gen will be that I'll never buy multiple consoles again. At most, I'll have 1 home, and 1 portable. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @browland1 Well... it did. For about the first year. But when the Mem Card pricing killed the sales, they dropped support really quick. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis True story... I actually played a round of CoD, where the guys name was XxXWhitePower69XxX. It was GOAT match. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis I don't love mine either... I also don't care.. because it's not like my name is XxXWhitePowerDickRider69XxX <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Folders, and demo/beta library removal are top tier changes PS4's UI needs. Why the fuck do you care if people can see you online or not? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Yeah... lets all vote for the worst thing on that list of features. How bout no https://t.co/vx7cHhSNeJ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 Srsly though...probably just play MP. Seems to be the strength of the game (and the franchise) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 The spoil appears to be that the campaign isn't very good :} <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis bring the hype 4 dreams... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Where's Dennis at with all the true Pony PGW hype...? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> For the record, I never believed that Sony/Hello would stealth release NMS. Although, after E3, nothing would surprise me at this point. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @passthemstickss I'd say a little bit of both. Shame, because the game is a lot better than some of the shitty reviews. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @passthemstickss Neither, but if I had a Xbone, I'd probably buy Halo... just because. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @fourhman The firm answer on the interwebz is "Maybe, pending more internets" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Brah...Why isn't *insert franchise* annualized/announced. Oh and fuck *insert annualized franchise* for being annualized. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RNG being "fun" would be supported if the FotM decks in the game over the past 6+mths weren't all extremely predictable decks. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Reading opinion pieces where "pros" are saying RNG is what makes Hearthstone fun. Cool story, how much did Blizz pay you for that opinion? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Let's establish now, that PS4s share functionality is gonna be gold for Fallout 4 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Joesff bugs are only cool when it's to mock Ubisoft. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Honestly, I should have posted my invisible Assassin's bug from Syndicate... Because it was GOAT. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Posting the same bug 10 times to twitter doesn't justify your shitty review faux gaemz jurnaliztz <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Isn't that the site that couldn't tell the difference between UC2 remaster, and UC4? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Halo 4's MP player base was decimated by CoD. It's interesting to see if that's the case this time, vs BLOPSIII &amp; Battlefront. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The general consensus is that the multiplayer is improved, and the single player is a bit of a mess. Test will be 2 (and 3) weeks from now. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Doesn't matter anyway. It's been a long time since the franchise was the genre defining, generation spanning shooter, that everyone played. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> aww...Halo isn't the complete trainwreck I was expecting it to be. Was really looking forward to all the shitposts about the game... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheFrugster game is good, and the FPS has zero impact. GAF gotta be GAF and piss and moan about literally everything. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GuerrillaDawg its not like he's wrong... Fucking Nintendoyearolds...:| <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @nsuttner: Wattamess! @funomena https://t.co/IXX7ca1w1n <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Also bought the Fallout 4 Season Pass. Because reasons. Sorta want to buy something else random, but I probably shouldn't. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Walmart being Walmart... Which means their mistakes saved me $20 on my toaster. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GuerrillaDawg thanks for having gud taste dawg. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> So hold ur butts... And don't read Neogaf posts after the show. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> We're only a couple days from the PGW press conference, when Sony will show games I actually care about (unlike the AAA nonsense at E3) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Money I got for my iPad gets to go to buy a new toaster... And maybe the fallout season pass. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis But it is hilarious... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Cool. Got more $$ for my old iPad mini, that I would have for my Wii U. ($170) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 yup. Everything else is trash. Git Gud at vidya gaemz. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 it takes effort to have taste this good... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 that's unfortunate. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Hoping my old boss picks up Blops. Like to play online co-op with non-randos <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Should be no new releases for me this week (yay).
Then it's Blops &amp; NFS... Fallout... Battlefront...in 3 consecutive weeks. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Earned 9 PS4 trophies (7 bronze, 1 silver and 1 gold) in Assassin's Creed Syndicate - https://t.co/p4uUPiZ39W <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis 3DS games are the only ones I feel that are overpriced, and that's largely because of exchange. $50 for a handheld title...nah <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Most of the people that can't afford video games are validly broke (and should probably save $$) or are kids that rely gifts. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Seriously... kids making stupid comments about the validity of game pricing is hilarious. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> TFW Nintendoyearolds say that vidya gaemz are too expensive. :| <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Finished Ep1 of Tales from the Borderlands. Again. Oh well. It's a great series, so I don't mind replaying the first 2 episodes. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch Yeah... that's easily the worst TT game I've played... and I've been playing their shit since Sam &amp; Max. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch Well... 1 is good. 1 is ok. and 1 is the worst game TT has made since Jurassic Park. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I have a fucking Telltale marathon of games... Borderlands. GoT. Back to the Future... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis I'm also off for 2 1/2 wks after the baby gets here... so yeah, should be fine. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> And I have 2-3wks to beat 1 more game to hit my goal of 50 for the year... before the baby comes and eats up all my time/sleep. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Now I don't really know what to play... PS4 haz no gaemz after all. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Ending/End Boss was typical AC nonsense. Still... all in all... jankiness aside, it's a pretty great game. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Syndicate has one of my favourite named Trophies/Achievements. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Well, That's that.

Assassin's Creed® Syndicate
Shall We Dance?(Gold) #PS4share https://t.co/VhzX8DXyI0 https://t.co/LNouTIuGp1 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch God Tier character yo. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 That game isn't real. It's like Shenmue 3 and The Last Guardian. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> :| Ubisoft PLS. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis @isaparrot No clue where you can get a $10 card. I use https://t.co/QqThry7tYh to get digital PSN cards. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis I wish I could be half as shit as most of GAF... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis "this studio still has the ability to release quality like they did in the PS1 days" lol <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 Reason 7145 for why I'll never move to the states. That shit would never fly here. Tenant rights and such. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GuerrillaDawg Nintendoyearolds gotta Nintendo... (meaning be shit) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 Don't you rent? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 I'm having a hard enough time accepting that I'll likely only get $80-$100 for my new 3DS, because there's 0 interest here <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 another reason why I can't be bothered. It's not worth getting rid of at that price lol. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Sequence 8. Barring any craziness, I'll have the story beat tonight. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 Did you actually get anything for it? You're lucky if you get $100-$150 up here for a 32gb unit <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 Honestly, the only reason I've kept mine is for my VC library. I can go back and play the good 2D Mario games :} <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 It's ok... that was the last time any game will release for it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Sorry... you were progressing too fast. Please go back and do some side stuff before continuing. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Dawg's check from Sony came in this month... :} <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> lol Had a stupid moment where I questioned why a bunch of Sony employees have private trophy lists on the PSN. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It's nice that the game acknowledges that Jacob is a tool. Because he is. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GuerrillaDawg is that legit? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> On to Sequence 7 of 9. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> At the rate I'm going, I'll probably be finished the main story in Syndicate by tonight. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis and some times projects get scrapped (like Sony Bend, and Santa Monica) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheFrugster ur high AF <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Earned 8 PS4 trophies (7 bronze and 1 silver) in 2 games - https://t.co/p4uUPiZ39W <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheFrugster "now"? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Or to be one of those awful people that post "indiestation 4" on every PSBlog post. Poor Souls. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Can't imagine what it must be like for those people that refuse to play anything that isn't from one or two genres. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Some people have really awful taste in video games. I'm not one of those people. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis The Devil's Third Cover Art of countries. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @browland1 I'm thinking about it... depends how much extra money I have kicking around in Dec/Jan <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Man... Some people really are trash aren't they. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis who cares... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @passthemstickss You also don't blog fan fict on Tumblr dot com. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NintendoTweet The thirst for games to not buy is real. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Yay. Made it through the mission without it fucking up anymore. woo. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It's like I'm Dennis or something. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ...this mission. Figured out bug one... move forward... do stuff... fall through the world. lolz <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @passthemstickss Thankfully it was super easy. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> FFS. Seems like I've found a progression breaking bug in Syndicate. awesome. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> :| Graphical glitches are fun yo. I'd make a Ubisoft comment, but the UC3 remaster was actually worse. Oh well. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Evie &gt; Jacob. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> One of my main critiques of ACIII and IV was that colonial America (and the Caribbean) were bad locales for AC based on architecture <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Aside from that, the characters are more interesting than Arno, and the city design is great. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> having spent 6 or 7 hours in Syndicate, my only real complaint is that the traversal system is a bit more janky than Unity, or it is for me. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ok... time to get all the sync points done in Syndicate. Hate not having the full map/fast travel. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> the stupidest part about still being up, is that I haven't really done much of anything for the past hour or so. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I still don't really understand WTF you're supposed to do in GTA Online. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Sleeping is 4babies... and last time I checked, I wasn't a Nintendo fan. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I should probably sleep... but no. I'd rather not. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> hooray... Jays are out of the playoffs. Now all the bandwagon jumper baseball fans in the GTA can STFU about Baseball. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch Pls keep that shit out there ok... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch Feel free to remove the 5. Halo's story, from start to finish is some of the worst... gameplay was great back in the day tho <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Syndicate is pretty great. Combat is a bit too easy again, except when it's not... but still... like the game a lot. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> This was the first SF combo I ever learned #PS4share

https://t.co/WPuj6HnvwQ https://t.co/8oWyvJhA5A <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Joesff neither :} <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The open world twist for Zelda U will be that it's completely linear, in a big empty open world. :} <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Also, Jacob is a tool, so I'm mostly sticking with Evie. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Only on Sequence 4, but fucking around and getting collectables...because reasons. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis nah. You just wish you could be as edgy as me. Deep down, you just want to be shit like the rest of the gaming community... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis I'm not wrong. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The best part of there being so many AC games is that it proves how little the opinions of the cynical "HARDCORE GAEMER" means. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheFrugster cool story bro. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Not improving in SFV at all... being I'm impatient as shit. Every match I've lost was my own fault because I get ahead and do stupid shit. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch Dats mi alt account brah... y u hatin'... Xbot :} <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @bfletchtone It's early, so it could improve... it just doesn't feel good to play. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch It is. It's more fun than Unity, and runs better... but it's still pretty janky. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @bfletchtone It's under "NDA", but it's the game that's in closed alpha that name rhymes with Boom. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @bfletchtone lol it's ok. It was a test... so I didn't pay anything. Still, disappointing none the less. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Uninstalling Hearthstone again. Not sure why I keep going back. It's a F2P game based around expensive FotM decks... because money. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch I haz no gaemz <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> TFW you get to play a game you were really looking forward to, and it ends up being complete and utter trash <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Seriously... :| At least it saves me $80 next year. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Been a long time since I enjoyed a FPS game less then this... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Earned 3 PS4 trophies (3 bronze) in Assassin's Creed Syndicate - https://t.co/p4uUPiZ39W <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis lol well... new Sony isn't dumb. That's totally something I could have seen Kaz &amp; Ken cook up. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis You're probably not wrong. Splitting the player base with an "improved" PS4 would probably be suicide. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis There's always a chance. Sony needs to encourage people to purchase the console again, and it doesn't die like the 360 did... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> At that point, I might as well just be a PC Master Racer... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> "high performance" console mid gen would basically be my exit from consoles. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis I don't even have a Vita anymore. Handheld gaming is for pleebs. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Sony not working on 1st party Vita titles isn't news. It's been like that for almost 2 years. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> lol people shitting on players in closed alpha. Cool Story Bro. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> *for the past 2yrs. https://t.co/T4IzISexWH <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Somehow a project that I'd size as 18-24mths has 3mth to be completed because everyone runs around like chickens w/their heads cut off. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The only thing that's close, is being told a project is a priority, and then have it sit for 5mths so it needs to be completely redone. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> There is literally nothing more frustrating than being assigned a project that requires information from management, and they go silent. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Dragon Priests... Dragon Warriors... Secret Pallys... HS is as fun as being mauled by a bear right now. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @SuperNintendad bugs and jank-i-ness aside... yeah, it's actually really good. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @SuperNintendad lol Yup. Only thing that was visible was a new weapon they were holding... and Evie popped in for a sec. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> lol Syndicate bug FTW. Jacob and Evie are GOAT assassins... they're invisible in the cut scene. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @PranooYY That's unfortunate (that it never isn't an action game). <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @PranooYY Does it ever actually feel like an OG RE game? I only played the first 2 episodes <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @PranooYY lol It was one of the worst things I've played this year. It was just another action focused RE game from what I played. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @PranooYY It's an episodic game... remember. Even on disk, it's just a collection of all the shitty episodes. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I was unimpressed with the other game I played tonight. Gonna try it a bit more over the weekend before writing it off. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It's 2am. I (technically) work (from home) tomorrow. I should get some sleep. I'll fuck around in AC more tomorrow. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> AC Syndicate feels good. It bypasses a lot of slow start up that the AC series tends to have. Characters (early on) are some of the best. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Can't sleep... might as well start Syndicate <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 Not a fan of games w/auto combat mechanics. Big reason why I think Xenoblade Chronicles was terrible. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 I just didn't care for the combat, and I'm not sure the game makes much sense as a portable title because of the combat. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Killstrain is probably my fav of the Sony F2P games in beta right now. It's a lot of fun. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheFrugster Combat system. Eliminate about 500 or so Pokemon. Give the game an actual story. Make it a real JRPG. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheFrugster I'll pass on both. Pokemon needs a drastic overhaul to basically everything, and Yokai is too strongly aimed a young kids. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ...ugh... why was that demo so short and pointless. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DaRealMatthew Yeah... really little kids. I couldn't envision playing the game for 20+ hrs or so... if not more. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DaRealMatthew Yeah, it sure is different. Just seems a bit too simple... more about interaction than strategy. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @browland1 lol What game? Planetside 2... or do you not know? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Yokai design really makes Pokemon bad though...real bad. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Yokai seems like it would be a pretty terrible game to play on the go...Sort of unfortunate. Art style and game itself are charming. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Not really a fan of Yokai's combat system. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @SuperNintendad Had to register on the Doom site. I think people that bought Wolf New Order got priority though. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @SonySanDiego: Return of the Kill Strain: https://t.co/0wx2dTCRxQ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 That's what I did... I'm paid up (for the most part) until Q2 of next year. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @victoredfield registered on their site. I think I get priority because I bought Wolf New Order at launch. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Such excite #PS4share https://t.co/IimcFay0Ry <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @DOOM: Did you get into the DOOM MP Alpha? The action starts at midnight ET! https://t.co/Z8IdbkDSEh <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @browland1 It's my favourite since II. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Such Alpha Code... much excite. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch Xbone will give ya AIDs...think that's one of the gaf slogans <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch and this is a surprise...? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Some how... I'm like 5-3 with Nicalli tho. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm trash at SF. Execution is real bad... And I button mash mid combo. Gud timez <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> still really hate Vega... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Didn't know about that... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis I don't think so... Polytron is working on SuperHyperCube sans Fish. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis GAF iz trash. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Good stuff at PSX this year. Again. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheFrugster @ItsameDennis That's not what you implied though. You were saying quantity over quality. Order was a solid 6.5hr game. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheFrugster @ItsameDennis So you'd rather play hot trash for 100hrs than a good/great game for 5-6? pls <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Flunkie Sort of random that they added that today... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheFrugster @ItsameDennis Really awful way to judge games... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> "Content Creators" need Youtube/Google infinitely more than Google needs them. Lets see them try and self host their videos. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Gaming community has really been "drinking the koolaid" when it comes to the rights of Youtubes so called "content creators" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis It was basically Gears, with less homosexuality. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @PranooYY Good. YTers are give too much respect and power right now. Take the deal, or find another host for your "content". <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Internet is a good place to get out the negativity... that way you end up being less of an asshole to people in real life. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 most of the new Atlus stuff is $60 here now. It's pretty gross. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> A few days ago Canada's PM was a racist sociopath... now our new PM is recorded dancing to traditional Punjabi music. Good work Canada. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 It's $50 up here for all new 3DS games... when I made the comment, I thought Nintendo was gouging for Yokai... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis lol I think you could buy either an Xbone or PS4 and be happy. Obviously happier w/PS4, because it's GOAT like Sony. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 I would have thought about it...but $50 for a 3DS game is insane. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Wii and Wii U just taught me that Nintendo isn't trust worthy, and people shouldn't buy their hardware. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis I just think it's implied that the stakeholder would support the console for it's life span, rather than a fraction of it <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis To be fair, Nintendo kind of owes their consumers more than 5 years of support in the past 10 for their home consoles. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Shame my system has a scratch on it..."new" Majora 3DS's are going for close to $300 here. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Not sure I have the patience for Kijiji though... I hate trying to private sell consoles. :| <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> My bad... $50 CAD is the new std 3DS pricing apparently. Probably just gonna sell the thing if that's the case. No 3DS game is worth that. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Nintendo is asking $50 for a translated version of a nearly 3yr old game. Nah. I'll pass. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GuerrillaDawg How are you not 500lbs... or dead. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Earned 13 PSN trophies (10 bronze, 2 silver and 1 gold) in 5 games - https://t.co/p4uUPiZ39W <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I won't be buying Shenmue 3 or Final Fantasy VII remake, when ever they actually happen... So I don't really care what happens w/them. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Cool... more FGC members are complaining about SFV's low skill entry point. Street Fighter community is going full Melee on this one. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Of course not... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis People were bitching a week ago because Yu was saying that they could use more money... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @passthemstickss And RotTR is eventually coming to PS4... it's not unprecedented, but it seems really unlikely. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @passthemstickss That quote was really taken out of context. Pretty sure if Sony is providing funding, it's not gonna happen. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I kind of want one of the 20th Anniversary controllers... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Anyone know if Sony has improved the sticks on the new controllers? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @PranooYY ? Sorry... I thought you were just talking about more of those awful Avatar movies. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @PranooYY I was sort of hoping he'd die before more of those movie get made... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis I've bought all 5. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis As long as you're complaining about the dumb community... that's fine. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Three Fourths Home is interesting. Cool little experience, but it leaves a lot of things in its story unanswered, which is sort of a drag. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis And ur surprised why? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @browland1 You have to hate Ubisoft/EA/Activision though... otherwise, you're not a gamer. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Well... I've made it further in this season of Hearthstone than I usually do. Normally I get bored around rank 20-18... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I still prefer Sony's EU shows to E3... because the EU shows usually aren't all about ho-hum AAA games. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> SFV Online is pretty solid. Only one match had noticeable lag, and that was against someone in the UK. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Israel is going full 'Murica with it's retelling of history and associate power tripping nonsense. Be nice if people could get along... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Israel blaming the Palestinians for the Holocaust now. 
That is what we like to call revisionist history, friends... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> https://t.co/QpsCyJFnkZ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Sort of wish Syndicate would unlock already... I have some work to do though. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> If I ever do another blog post, it should be an essay on why AC Black Flag is, at it's core, a really awful Assassin's Creed game. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheWorldWarGame Majors gave it good scores. I feel like some of the smaller sites are being edgy just to echo "core gamer" cynicism. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @PranooYY Carter and Rapture are fairly short experiences... I personally recommend trying to play them in a couple sittings if possible. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Stealth___ lol who gave it a 2? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Big sites give AC between a 8-9. Small sites give it 6 and below. Who's trust worthy? No one :D Every game site has an agenda :} <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @PranooYY lol I honestly get why people don't like AC... I just like being an ass about it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @PranooYY But don't you buy all the Souls games :} <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @PranooYY it's because you hate nice things... :} <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I pre-paid for Syndicate months ago. IMO Unity was the best AC since 2. I was going to enjoy this game anyway. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> so yeah... the 5 from Videogamer appears to be a disposable review used to push their agenda that Ubi games are bad. Nice try guys. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> 9 from GI <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It's actually scoring higher than I expected from the majors. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> IGN w/an 8.2. Polygon w/8.5. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Cool... VG being edgy again. Need them clicks I suppose. Pushing that agenda. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheFrugster Trash site giving a trash review. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Well... Gamespot gave Syndicate a 9... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Cool... only a little while til i get to see all the 6s and 7s roll in for AC Syndicate... 'cause reviewers need to be edgy. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Best ever #PS4share

<Text_Begin> Don't play SFV with English VO. It's worse than most shitty anime dubs... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Three Fourths Home is an interesting project that would have never existed on consoles a few years ago. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch About the threat to Canada... Gay Muslims. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch Boy's gettin' to work on this shit right quick... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Ok... Definitely can't do Tales right now... Need to play a more vidya gaem-y game. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Sometimes I forget that people like offset analog sticks on gamepads for some reason. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis True story. Xbone Sticks, or some good quality caps, and that controller is true GOAT. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Cool #PS4share https://t.co/jvDOW9j1Od <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Pretty much is... The Steam Link doesn't work well either. Based PC Master Race <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheFrugster that doesn't look like Inafune <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Told a VP at work that I wanted to ask a PM if they were high... We agreed that probably wasn't professional. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I still like Beyond more than the Colin &amp; Greg thing... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GuerrillaDawg Srs though, most people have said it's fine. Not ACII or anything but an improvement from Unity. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GuerrillaDawg I trust the opinion of no one on GAF... sry Dawg. If I wanted to hear shit opinions, I'd listen to recordings of myself :} <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GuerrillaDawg Have been largely positive from what I've seen... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @johnnydork meh... I have plenty to play this year. (Syndicate, BLOPS, Battlefront, Fallout, NFS, Just Cause)... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @johnnydork I'll get it holiday 2016. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Curious to see if YT Red folds in with Google Play Music. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DaRealMatthew So either the insanely far right... or the sort of right. Gud timez. Well, your electoral process is trash anyway. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @johnnydork I wouldn't. I'm sort of opposed to "content creators" getting income from YT for their vids. Patreon is a better solution. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @johnnydork @ItsameDennis I loved my Xbox 1. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @johnnydork @ItsameDennis Back when Microsoft actually had internal studios and made shit that wasn't one of 4 franchises... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DaRealMatthew Isn't Bernie a half assed socialist (since you could never be a full ass socialist in the US and get support) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GuerrillaDawg https://t.co/Yomd31ZXX1 ... Dawg... pls <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NintendoTweet Honestly, I haven't read the details. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I suspect that very few people will actually pay for YT Red, and continue to use adblockers instead. People aren't "into" being ethical. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheFrugster Literally every game that garners attention is a circle jerk though. Look at the Souls games. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Youtube Red is logical, and interesting. People always say that they'd pay for a service if it got rid of ads... time to see if they do. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheFrugster Sort of like the *insert any game* circle jerk would if you give too much attention to it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 They can't. YT already pays them for views/subs. This is YTs way of bypassing Adblockers I guess... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Gamers are shitting on PayDay 2 for doing the same shit that Valve does for TF2 and DOTA2. Double standards are fun. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis https://t.co/mfARGnX1hx <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 Nah... there's still a Bush running... so clearly there are more useless people out there. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> My assumption is that the people in the FGC that rely heavily on bs gimmicks, are going to cry a lot about SFV. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Reading about people shit-talking SFVs easy accessibility. High level allows people to punish on mistakes, vs gimmicks. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Earned 7 PS4 trophies (7 bronze) in Life Is Strange - https://t.co/p4uUPiZ39W <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> BttF day is nice, because it gives us one day where nerds will talk about something other than The Force Awakens. :} <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @SuperNintendad @Mattmanver2 I'm scared... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 putting *insert pop culture thing* in any game is a cringe worth bandwagon jump... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 ...that's how the "theme-d" packs for game are... There's a Star Wars character pack for Minecraft FFS (and Dr Who) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 Why not? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @PranooYY Yes. Great classic Adventure game. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @PranooYY I'm "that guy" that liked S2 more. I liked Wolf more than either though... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @PranooYY From what I played, it felt like TTs best series... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @PranooYY Is the ending as good as the reviews say? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I also have a year to work with one of our friends on creating a tiny N7 uniform for Halloween next year <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @CodeRedShell Yeah... I know. Luckily my in-laws are going a bit crazy w/gifts, and my nephew is 2 and a half, so we got hand-me-downs <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 man... licensed baby clothes are expensive. Once he's a toddler I'll look into that stuff. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 sounds like trash... I'll probably download it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It's real hard to buy clothes for baby boys that isn't covered in sportsing bullshit... or cars. Fuck Cars and Sportsing. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Media Create numbers matter even less than NPD... yet people still act like they're a bit deal. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis They'd buy 2 if it came with an amiibo of Reggie's penis. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Nintendo exploiting their fans again... like Splatoon... and Mario Maker... and amiibo... and the Wii U. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Still don't really understand who Triforce Heroes is for... It seems like a new gen revisit of 4swords... which wasn't good the first time. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Pretty sure that they don't understand FF wasn't a Metroid game, and it had the license slapped on to sell units. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I've still never managed to make it out of the first Song of Fire and Ice book. Bad structure, and a lot of dull characters. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Cool... Telltales worst series since Jurassic Park will finally be done in November. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis They need to try and out "Uncharted", Uncharted... in every way... including spoils. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis I legit feel bad for the Sony employees that are really excited to bring interesting games to people..because they get shit on <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 Only because of all the nerds talking about it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 Well... that explains it. I'm real bad at 80s pop culture references. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 ...what's the reference? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 I play adult games... none of that Nintendoyearold nonsense <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 *correction* the games you play... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Honestly, PS4 selling so well has been the best and worst thing for gaming. It's good to see console not be dead, but the community is trash <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> PS4 shitfan cycle https://t.co/rzp53P9VHr <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Didn't realize that Fappy the anti-masturbation Dolphin was a thing... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> https://t.co/mu9OUXMiNs <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> https://t.co/VNiKl6mIjA <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I never really watch alt ending for games, but people were firing up the WAAAAmbulance about this one, so I had to check it out. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Watched the "bad" ending for LiS on YT. Still not that bad...It's just sort of empty. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @bfletchtone https://t.co/XSzIM8eCOr <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I wanted to play through Tales from the Borderlands before Syndicate launched... But I don't feel like that will happen. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @bfletchtone not unlike Star Wars I would say. 80s nerds need to CTFO lol <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I have no interest in Vega... And I'll hook up my stick and try Rishad tonight. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Nicalli having a charge dash, when the rest of his moves are std shoto motions felt sort of awkward. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @johnnydork consumers are bitches... Srsly though... I canceled my Just Cause 3 preorders until Sony fixed the store, and it took my money. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Mika's command grab seemed to have real short range... Probably me fucking up... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @johnnydork NA PSN takes the full amount. I think they legally can't in some countries in the EU. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Spent a couple minutes with Mika and Nicalli before I left for work. Not sure how I feel about either right now. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @johnnydork I just keep 'em anyway. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> SFV beta is up... and I need to go to work <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis I'm edgy. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis People deserve a bad ending for saving tumblr dot com the character... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis I saved the town... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis (as in episode length) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis But the ending isn't bad... it's just sort of predictable. And I was talking about the amount of time they had to wrap it up. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis At it's worst, the Mass Effect ending was predictable. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Ok? I think LiS ending was fine. They were clearly limited by the format though, and had to rush at times... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I can only assume that the people that are "mad" about the ending to LiS are the same folks that got emo about the ending to Mass Effect 3. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch lol pretty safe prediction. I said the same thing the day he announced he was joining the Liberal party... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Well... that was a pretty solid finale. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @PranooYY you're ahead of me... those plats help though... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis nice <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis is it Neil or Bruce? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GuerrillaDawg Talking about things I don't actually care about, but want to bitch about it anyway? That's internet done right... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GuerrillaDawg I honestly don't care... Dude was from what? Firefly? Look at all the fucks I give about his vidya gaem opinions lol. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GuerrillaDawg It's not about PR, it's about respect. He left because Todd got canned... not because of any other reason. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @SuperNintendad You may be one of the few people that buy more games than me (although I did get Organ Trail) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GuerrillaDawg Doesn't really matter, his quote was unprofessional. He could have handled it a lot better... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GuerrillaDawg Shit talking a project because your friend got canned isn't exactly classy though... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Gods among casual filth. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Pretty sure your the only person other than me that's looking forward to dreams... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GuerrillaDawg Whew lad indeed. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GuerrillaDawg Beta was... outside of the story stuff... which was... well... you'll see. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis I assume it's better than the last Turn10 Forza's... since they weren't very good <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GuerrillaDawg Dogs can't have CC... that's probably why. (Seriously, that happened to me for years... Sony support sort of sucks about it) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @johnnydork I've barely played... It's still one of the few AAA games I'd recommend to people this year. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @johnnydork Probably won't/shouldn't given Sony's holiday line up. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @johnnydork Still a new-ish game... and Sony hasn't even pushed it yet. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Well... LiS Ep5 is up on the NA PSN. Waiting on Tales... Picked up Organ Trail Complete Edition. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Cool. I'll listen when I get home <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Could have been Nickelback... or Staind... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Is it wubwub... ? I'm at work right now. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Who the fuck is that...? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> WTF does Guitar Hero have RMT... shouldn't it generate revenue through addition songs via DLC? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Shame there's no SP content though... Can't seem to get into GTAOnline... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Renton127 Unfortunately that's an issue with MadCatz, rather than the Rock Band series... games have been better for some time. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis fuck. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Man... I really missed that time when music games were essentially dead. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Joesff lol I know. Lars just took heat because of the Napster nonsense... half the people that hate on him weren't even alive then. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Joesff Aren't they 70 or something now... I just assumed Metallica sounds like Nickelback 2. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Nah... you know who's fault this really is... https://t.co/ocuholJu0m <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis All because 2 games that were destined to have shit stories, in fact, had shit stories. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Dat GAF community. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Telus still doesn't have the Nexus 5X or 6P listed on their site yet. I'm not upgrading 'til Dec, but I want to know the prices. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DaRealMatthew I haven't really listened to any music in the past few months... Just podcasts. And I love silence. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @PranooYY Well... you guys got LiS Ep5 before us... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DaRealMatthew I turn off the radio when I get in the car with my wife... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @PranooYY It's supposed to be up on the NA store this afternoon... not sure about the EU one. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Story and Character development was the weakest parts of that franchise. It was all about encounter design and mechanics. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The thing that still amuses me is that people expected good writing from the people that brought you Halo. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DaRealMatthew Nah... All pop music is awful. It always has been. Issue is that "pop" is short for popular and isn't genre specific. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @browland1 It actually isn't... there's people that are serious about some "white genocide" or similar nonsense. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> "Forced: Slightly Better Edition" is the most self-aware video game title ever. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Also, I'll take a kid over seeing a movie any day... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm not actually that salty about the Star Wars thing. I've still never watched any of the OG trilogy from start to finish... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis yup. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Fun Fact; I still haven't watched the Star Wars trailer... because fuck everyone that gets to see it in theaters. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis Shitty Nintendo fans? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NintendoTweet Liberal Majority. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheSharkSurname Konami does... I guess. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 lol I saw that. I'm not making these memes... https://t.co/FdWYiES8Yy <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 Admittedly, the last 3-4 chapters of UC2 are the weakest chapters in the series (including Golden Abyss). <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 https://t.co/Mm4RBRgqkH <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 https://t.co/nPON4yD0Es <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> After replaying the UC Trilogy, including my first completion of UC1... I can say that UC3 is still the best game in the series. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 No, but you also like amiibo, so your opinion is factually invalid. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheSharkSurname If his contract, including non-compete, doesn't end until Dec... he technically hasn't lol. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis TFTB is probably TT best series... funny that they've done their best and worst (GoT) work this year. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis I like Amy (UC3 is the best one)... That being said, there were clearly issues with her vision, so I don't get the negativity <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ItsameDennis B-tier actor makes comments about leaving a project after friend is fired from project. More news after the weather. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Renton127 Alan Tudyk? He's B-tier at best. His friends got let go, of course he's going to shit talk the project after he left it... lol <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Renton127 It's worth noting that those comments came from a shitty actor, that was friends with people let go from ND <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 Why didn't you get the drive fixed under warranty? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 @Joesff It's legitimately my most disappointing game of the year (mostly because I knew I wouldn't love Witcher 3) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 @Joesff Don't. I played it on PC. Bad level design, float-y platforming controls, and poorly thought out combat mechanics. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Joesff @Johnnyebs06 That game was trash anyway. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 Xbone haz no gaemz... your HDD should be empty. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 I'd assume it's a patch, so it'll replace some files. If the game is actually ~70gb, that might be a new record. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @SuperNintendad @Joesff At least. For me, it's likely just cheaper to pay for a month of PSNow sub, and try and beat them both. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Joesff I'll have to rent them via psnow, since I sold my PS3 a while back. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I should probably play Ico and Shadow before TLG releases. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GuerrillaDawg and all the Supernatural elements are replaced with nanomachines. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Difficulty aside, N++ is great for kids, because the entirety of the stage is on a single screen. No need to guide the player along. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> My good deed for the weekend was convincing my 8yr old nephew that N++ and Spelunky were better to play than CoD. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Between PSN and PC I have about 600 "not games". I'm clearly missing out. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Shame people have shit taste, and only acknowledge AAA exclusives as games. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Cool... I needed my reminder that people are still trying to go with the "PS4 haz no gaemz" angle. System has plenty. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Bestbuy Canada is doing a midnight opening for Halo. First one of those they've done in a while. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch Reminder that most of Nintendo's core franchises have been on a steady decline for almost a decade... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> You did good Canada. You did good. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Of course the fucking hillbillies in the prairies voted Conservative <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 Except for amiibo. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> People are buying tickets to a movie that doesn't open for 2 months... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> TFW someone concedes in Hearthstone before you really do anything... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Lets all pretend we're shocked about PS4 being first on NPD again. This month will be the interesting one, as will next... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> oh...I guess LiS Ep5 is out tonight <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch need a bit of time to digest the ending of Ep4 tbh. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch #ConsoleMasterRace brah... Gotta wait for the PSN to update tomorrow for that and Ep5 of Tales from the Memelands. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ...well... I'm caught up in Life is Strange... ready for tomorrow. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> wait....wut. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Cool...Tons of stories about pre-marked ballots at early polls. All of the marked ballots were "voting" for the Conservatives. Not surprised <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @johnnydork Because the writing couldn't get any worse in Killzone... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch In a part 2 of the retro collection. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Would rather see Kojima make some art house style indie projects...No more games on the scale of MGS from him, thanks. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Now I just hope no studio is insane enough to get Kojima the bank he needs to make the games he wants to make... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Life is Feels. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @CodeRedShell for a home console, the amd APUs that MS and Sony use are likely barely more expensive than the PPC garbage Nintendo uses now. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @CodeRedShell If handheld is the primary focus, than they'll likely stick with an ARM/Tegra system, like most android devices... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @CodeRedShell I'm enjoying it a lot. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Almost caught up #PS4share https://t.co/WUuqna2RjH <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @CodeRedShell If it's not more powerful than 3yr old consoles... that were already a bit underpowered... I don't know what to say. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Ep 3 done.
Wut. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Moving forward #PS4share http://t.co/sPh1QDZbCZ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @SuperNintendad Yup. I liked it a lot. Be good to play w/kids that were MC fans. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @SuperNintendad Games beat this year. Never been much of a trophy collector. Only Plats are 2 for Walking Dead S1 lol <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Ep 2 down. Pulling ahead of where I was when I lost my saved game <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 Probably. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 Probably will never know. Nintendo won't release low numbers, and NPD doesn't include digital sales. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I need to up my shitty fanboi game. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> That Battlefront commercial is pretty solid. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Ep1 of LiS done (again). <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Election day in Canada. If you vote Harper... fuck you. That's all. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @skypunch90 @DaRealMatthew cool story bro. Your worthless opinion has been duly noted. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @skypunch90 @DaRealMatthew not a Yank. And I stand by my comment that the game is trash. Soulless is actually a good description. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DaRealMatthew doesn't make it less trash. One of the worst combat systems I've ever seen. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> 60sec in spoils #PS4share http://t.co/PjkLFTwavk <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> well... I'll play through LiS first. It's my second favourite "adventure" game this year. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Since I lost my saves... I really should play through Tales from the Borderlands and LiS. I'll probably skip the replay of GoT. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Earned 7 PS4 trophies (7 bronze) in Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception Remastered - http://t.co/p4uUPiZ39W <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Uncharted 3 Down. 46 on the year. Might squeak out 50 after all... 4wks 'til baby time. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @wlatham92 How can an online centric 3DS game not be a great idea...Especially one built solely around dungeons... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DaRealMatthew it's not. Probably one of the worst JRPGs on 3DS. It's a bad port of an overrated game <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> People seem to like TriForce Heroes... Means it's probably shit. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GuerrillaDawg what self respecting Master Racers is gonna buy AMD bullshit... shits the lowest of the low... <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> $45 after tax is the most I think I'd be willing to pay for a game on that system <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @passthemstickss lol Yeah, then I guess it makes sense to get it from them. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 If I never play a new 2D Mario game again... it'll be too soon. They're boring. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @passthemstickss Doesn't the Microsoft Store sort of suck... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 You opinion is factually incorrect. If I wanted 2D Mario, I have the good ones, on Virtual Console. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Johnnyebs06 So you haven't beat the only great Mario game in the past 8-10yrs. And you call yourself a fan. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 Nah... I'm sure everyone is going to analize the NX when it releases. It's already Doomed after all. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @fourhman Ultimately, if the new system is a hybrid (or a unified platform), they can fix the issues by not having to split resources. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @fourhman I assume by "retro" you mean VC, which was sort of a running joke this gen... Most of the smaller stuff was on 3DS. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @fourhman The issue with relying on 1st party support only, is that they've had 4+mth stretches w/o any release on Wii U. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @fourhman Lack of effort on their part is the issue. They made no real attempt to get meaningful support from 3rd parties after year 1. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Wii U had the 2nd best MK. Best Smash. Remaster of the best 3D Zelda, but it didn't get a Metroid, proper 3D Mario, or (likely) proper Zelda <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Funny to see Nintendo fans "defense forcing" the Wii U. Wii U is probably the system with the most unrealized potential since the Dreamcast. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @fourhman Not sure why people are surprised. This is Nintendo's mo in the home console space <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Gonna need to restart in Wasteland again... Sort of forgot how unforgiving OG CRPGs are. My poor crew is getting wrecked. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Aggressively priced hybrid system, with a proper account system, and more reliable online... Plus semi-current hw could help. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ...Wii U is a disaster commercially. It's felt abandoned since about 6mths post launch. Not sure what Nintendo does to win back consumers. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Nintendo is going to have a rough ride moving forward. Wii might have sold well, but left a bad taste in peoples mouth... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DaRealMatthew @SuperNintendad I wouldn't be surprised if the handheld was the more expensive part, with the "home" portion being a dock. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Sometimes I forgot that most "gaemerz" are pretty hateful towards Nintendo. I consider myself cynical, and jaded towards them. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Earned 27 PS4 trophies (22 bronze and 5 silver) in 5 games - http://t.co/p4uUPiZ39W <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DaRealMatthew If it's a hybrid... expect $400+ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> My sniper is such a clown #PS4share http://t.co/DTHVWJ89DK <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> CoD, Assassin's Creed... Halo...Fallout...Battlefront... These games could get 0 reviews and still sell well. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> TBH, I'm sure Ubisoft doesn't give a flying fuck what the enthusiast press has to say about Syndicate. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> AC Syndicate's embargo is the day before release... fail to see the problem with that <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> If I ever win the lottery, I'm retiring to be a game designer...which will be more work than I do now. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheFrugster Well... might not be good recognition they get... if these games end up more Korra, and less Bayonetta 2. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TheFrugster Kind of unfortunate. I don't think the studio can support the number of projects they have on the go...quality is gonna suffer. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Wife has her 3rd baby shower today. Guess this is what happen when it takes you nearly 15yrs to have a kid... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 but that's what I said... a hybrid means less Wii U-style games, not more. You're still gonna get all your weebo trash... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 Not really no. I had assumed you'd be disappointed with a single screen device... so...yeah... Dafuq u talkin' bout son. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I have 0 consumer interest in any hardware Nintendo makes moving forward. I just think its conceptually interesting. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 Why though? The 2nd screen is barely ever used on the 3/DS units in any meaningful way. It's usually just garbage down there. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 I don't really see why you think you'd lose that...Nintendo will likely shy away from making large budget AAA games on a hybrid <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 ...You lose nothing in that concept. Maybe gain the ability to only have to buy 1 Nintendo system for all your Nintendo "needs" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 I'm not really understanding why you're apposed to the hybrid concept. It sounds like you mostly play 3DS at home anyway... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 I'm saying it needs to be a hybrid, or a handheld... Don't make another home console that will just lose money <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 lol Look historically... outside of the Wii... Nintendo has lost about 20-25% of it's player base each gen in the home market. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 it either needs to be a hybrid, or they need to exit the home console market (which they won't) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 I'd rather see Nintendo go out of business, than 3rd party. And yes, I'm not buying anything the company makes... but still... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 There's also the absurd amount of R&amp;D that would go into 2 systems in pre-prod at the same time. It's not practical. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 Except Nintendo has done an awful job supporting either of their consoles this gen... Huge droughts w/o real 3rd party support. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> With Wii U on it's death bed, and 3DS looking long in the tooth... does Nintendo have a viable option other than a hybrid? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 Well... it's that, or they abandon one of the 2 platforms, as they clearly can't support 2 very well. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Ok... Bought Wasteland 2. Console controls are pretty decent. Need to invest time in building a team to start properly though. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Joesff Or at least enough that they hate to complain on twitter about them... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> TB might be an absolutely awful human being, but it's a shame about the cancer thing. No one really deserves that. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Considering picking up Wasteland 2 on PS4. Have it on PC, but I'm probably packing that system back up and storing it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Waking up at 3:00am... on a Friday...when I'm working from home. Only one thing to do...Play some games. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch That's kinda like about 80% of the Tales games <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Limits me to 3DS and iPad for the night. 4joy. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Thunderstorms... With the random brownouts in the area, I'm just shutting off the PS4 for the night. It gets randomly powered off enough. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Downwell is great... just need a console port now. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @devolverdigital: http://t.co/PSXrBhADIU <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> 3 King Krush's from that hunter, and I still won. I'm MLG bro. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch Just got 3 mana Gruul <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ETDragonPunch dem 1 mana Giants and Dragons tho... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Stupid random ass Tavern Brawl. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 I'm going to see how P5 sits before I think about buying any more JRPGs... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 Nah. I'm gonna laugh when only the PS4 version of DQ11 gets localized, because Sony pays the bill and cock blocks Nintendo. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 I suspect Sony and Omega Force footed the majority of that bill... Musou sells decently well over here. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 That's the whole thing with risk. Sometimes it pays off. Other times, it's Dragon Quest. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @PranooYY @Alcoholikaust ...ah...yeah... that. But it's innovative... right...? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> PS Blogcast needs to go up so I can see the hear the new releases for next week... I already have ACS paid for... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @PranooYY which? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 Localizations are like ports... people assume it's a $20 job... and it very much is not. JRPGs are expensive to localize too. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 ...its why I think crowdfunding localization is good idea. Ensure the game breaks even, before localizing. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 I actually think that SE is right with most of their localization discussions. Risk is likely too high for them... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 Yeah... if I was more of a console gamer growing up, I'd have more attachment to them. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 meh... I could mostly care less what Japanese devs do. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Also... banking on VR as a future for gaming seems like a real bad bet, given how resistant to change most gamers are. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 Saying, effectively, that AAA lacks innovation because the industry is run by white males... is kind of absurd. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 I support the concept that women need representation in the industry. So do racial minorities. Her quote is ignorant though... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It doesn't matter who makes the games; Man, Woman, Black, White, Llama...It's who finances them. Games are art, hindered by prohibitive cost <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> "To me when we're talking about women in tech at its core this is about making better games"
That quote gets me right in the lolz. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Brianna Wu being Capt Obvious again. All while slandering other devs at the same time. Nice touch. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Earned 9 PS4 trophies (8 bronze and 1 silver) in Uncharted 2: Among Thieves Remastered - http://t.co/p4uUPiHrLm <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> a.k.a. The best game in the series. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> On to UC3. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Really forgot how terrible the last few chapters of UC2 are. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 nothing more than likely. They'll announce Mobile stuff between now and then... but as a Direct... I'd hope not. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 No more directs til E3 and the NX reveal. Then bi-monthly to try and build hype. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 The super special part is that she waited 3 or 4 years to do it... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 Rebels is no where near as good as Clone Wars from what I saw of it... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 Disney's lucky... SW nerds are super crazy, and drink this shit up... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mattmanver2 And TV show... and theme park... and branding on literally ever product imaginable. They did the same thing with Marvel... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'll agree with the sane person that says Disney has gone a bit too Disney with Star Wars... and the first movie isn't even out yet. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @wlatham92 There's Chewbacca snowsuits for newborns <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Managed to get $40 worth of PSN credit for $36. Same site has $50 for $45. I'll buy something, just don't know what yet... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Well... this will be fun... extremely limited budget, and I need to find something on the PSN to put me over the $100 spent mark... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Outside of my normal anti-Nintendo propaganda, I'm genuinely not interested in that new Zelda. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NintendoTweet lol. You probably want to try that game though. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Seems that I finally unsubscribed enough that Nintendo got the hint and didn't send me demo codes. Good. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It's still crazy to me that Charles Darwin, and Karl Marx are going to be in a video game. Together. Don't make them muppets Ubisoft. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Cleared out a bunch of stuff on my 3DS...I probably still won't play most of the stuff that's there. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Fallout 3's DLC was great... so was Skyrim's. People expecting more than a couple of hours of content for $10-$15 are high. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Soony™ needs to put the Fallout 4 Season Pass up on the PSN store... need to get that paid for already <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @wlatham92 In MMOs, that stuff is "instanced" and unique content from the rest of the world. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @wlatham92 True. I guess the other sort of shitty thing, is that most of the Strikes are just normal parts of the game w/new enemies. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @wlatham92 They should have added more raids. That's really the only spot where I'd be critical content wise. I still want full matchmaking. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @wlatham92 6-7 Strikes/instances, a Raid, and a bunch of PvP maps isn't that far off the average launch MMO tbh. <Text_End>
