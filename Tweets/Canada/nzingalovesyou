<Text_Begin> I thought I was taking the high road but I guess I should've wrote a text back saying "bitch" every second word. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Lowkey I think people like counter insults. They want you to say the negative things they too think about themselves but can't admit. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Answering would've made me the biggest cunt of all time. Ignoring the bullshit made me arrogant. Welp. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Sorry I didn't text you back counter insults because I'm secure enough in my stance about things. It's not being arrogant. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Like after all these days to say I'm arrogant. Ma'am..you texted me paragraphs like I owed you child support... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The most I can do is say "sorry you feel that way" which is to soothe your feelings. I really only mean I'm sorry when I burp or fart. lolol <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> No pansies man. No pansies. I can't deal with this "depressed children at 6" nonsense. Oh you dont have Xbox 1 you depressed? Stay there. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Call Child Services.. your mom spanked you cause you decided to pop style and cuss her. Yes this makes sense. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Always to the extreme. But you know who's taken it to the extreme right? Dem time out children LMAO <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> People acting like discipline means dragging your child by the hair and beating the shit out of them. Just calm down. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'll hear all children cuss off their parents and all I have to do is laugh. Gwan with your time out self. GWAN Nancy. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I am 25 years old.. and to this day.. and I have never even let my mother hear me swear. WHY? Because she BEAT THAT ASS lol <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Non beaten Twitter can gwan and go find the next school they want to shoot up because life didn't go their way. LOL https://t.co/CTJLDdiU0S <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> They don't even teach 'sticks and stones' anymore in school. Kids call you a name &amp; its BULLYING..no kids are just assholes sometimes. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @rauls2cool EXACTLY. People need to start raising tough kids again. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> And the soft ass people who have a problem with it too. Go put yourself on time out. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Fuck outta here. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I can't stand that shit. Abuse and discipline are two different things. Nobody said go beat your child with a cord. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Just pure nonsense. "Omg she called me weird, I need to go home and die" ..Unno need fi chill, it's called life. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> People want to know why kids are there cutting themselves and killing themselves over trivial things? Because you're raising pansies. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Why must everything be taken to the extreme? You tap your child's hand and it's ABUSE? Thats why kids are so soft these days. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Nobody said beat your child to death or leave bruises. People are talking DISCIPLINE. NOT ABUSE. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'll say it... if you didn't get licks they should just lock you up from now and spare the world the trouble. *sips tea* bout no licks. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> One of these days I'll be active on Snapchat.. I just feel its more for females who wants to lip sync lyrics while stroking their hair. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @_HOMent: I really wanna know what a stern talking and grounding really accomplishes https://t.co/8FPd7yQyJb <Text_End>
