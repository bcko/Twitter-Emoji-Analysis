<Text_Begin> and they said (and I quote) "okay okay I'll... Attempt" THAT IS SUCH A SHITTY PUN that I woke up infuriated lmao <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> their username was "Attempt" by the way. this is important because I was getting frustrated and was like "WAT R U EVEN DOING COME HERE" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> so I was taking a nap and dreamed about playing this video game with someone who did not seem to understand the concept of teamwork <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ohhh no wonder I feel like crap. stupid time of month right on the holidays lmao _(:3/ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ugh i feel all gross and exhausted still from yesterday's night out but if i take a nap right now my sleep schedule is gonna be all wonky <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @daisypeony oops wait more like "kuro iyuu" i'm so confused at the site i'm looking at the first is his pseudo? and the second his name <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @daisypeony oh i was on mobile so i was too lazy to check www it's Èªí‰∫ïÂãá shirai yuusuke... maybe a pseudonym <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ OH MY GOD YOU'RE RIGHT. i... totally forgot about ura!Ukyo wwwww and Natsuki (?) in utapri right? woops <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @himepuff !! THAT'S SO COOL <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @riajuunibyou yeah! it's one of those "shitty home life so other personality formed to protect him/take over during hard times" thing <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @tsukinohanshin he gets a gold star for trying www 2K sounds like 2karat too for the gold rtaing |D;; <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @riajuunibyou technically same body right so?? wwww <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @riajuunibyou is experiencing things the other isn't thus making it technically another person... i guess?? LMAO it's just weird bc <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @riajuunibyou how we're going to define separate individuals then NTR /would/ apply to this split personality case because one persona <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @riajuunibyou i was going to argue that archer's wealth of experiences basically makes him a different person from shirou but if that's <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @riajuunibyou LMAO well in this case they actually have two different bodies right? so I'd throw that into the NTR-zone <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @riajuunibyou still wondering if being NTR-ed by your other personality counts as NTR.. i mean i guess the spirit of it it still there ww <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ...... he has a cute growl/vocal fry too _(:3/ it's funny because the tone of his voice is pretty high like tenor-ish yet he has a rumble <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> also I just have to say I have no idea who the seiyuu is but WOAH he can give sawa a run for his money with his by-the-ear-whispers <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ but the ones I do remember reading usually have both personalities reconcile or merge somehow ;;; this one was really vague on that <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ LMAO you say "always" do you read these kind of things often?! I can't recall too many instances of this trope <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> What if K(eshiki) didn't even exist in the first place actually lmao and this guy was just too shy to be beast WWW #magiciantarot <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> but you hear dual voices ;;; the fianc√© and k(eshiki) THAT'S BITTERSWEET. like I guess they've merged? he lost or gave up?? #magiciantarot <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> and I mean he sounds like a sweet guy but !!!!! K(ESHIKI)!!! and then it ends with him saying he'll always be with you #magiciantarot <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I thought he was talking about K(eshiki) but nooo and then he starts imagining their future and kids #magiciantarot <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> and when he talks about the marriage ring he says something about it being "2K" with their names "Kouichi no K" LMAO #magiciantarot <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> what makes it worse is the heroine's name starts with K too LMAO so there was this moment where he asks her to marry him #magiciantarot <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> THAT ENDING!!! I kept waiting for a "KIDDING! It's actually me :D :D" but no.... it never came LMAO #magiciantarot <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> "Look it has my name and yours" NO I'M SORRY BUT I JUST WANT "K" BACK TOO LMAO you're the same but so different ;;; #magiciantarot <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> SHE DROPS IT LMAO (out of shock) and he's like "oh you're so surprised ;; I must have made you wait unnecessarily" #magiciantarot <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> YOU HEAR THE HEROINE JUST DROP HER BAGS IN SHOCK ;;;; he was waiting for her cause he wanted to give an engagement ring #magiciantarot <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> "Ah yes usually I go to sleep early but for some reason my mind is clear and I feel energized. I was also waiting for you" #magiciantarot <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> next track you come home at night BUT IT'S THE MORNING PERSONALITY "hm? you seem surprised to see me." #magiciantarot <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ahhh ;; "see you tomorrow... yes... tomorrow" HE SOUNDS SCARED + SAD BUT HOPEFUL "I promise I won't disappear" #magiciantarot <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> !!!! so he leaves at night after telling you that he's gonna take control over his other self (kill his other personality??) #magiciantarot <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> "I never told you my name, huh. It's "K" as in keshiki" ;www; UM I DIDN'T ASK FOR THESE FEELS IN MY R18 TRASH #magiciantarot <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> prompts self-awareness and ego in that chances to change your life may be available you just gotta be alert #magiciantarot <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> and the heroine was studying psychology www AND the magician tarot is a "manifestation of desires"  #magiciantarot <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> IT MAKES SENSE NOW there was a track with her bf/fianc√© and I was like "they sound similar.. cutting costs with seiyuu?" #magiciantarot <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> awkward when you prefer the manifested personality over the core personality??? #magiciantarot <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> "I was born to protect him but after meeting you I feel alive for the first time. I want to live for you" ;;; #magiciantarot <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> WOAH OKAY his monologue is pretty sad ;;;; "these sensations and this body is real and yet my existence is just an illusion" #magiciantarot <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> But night personality is agonized over not having full control of his own body and having to share the heroine www #magiciantarot <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> NTRed by... himself?! www basically there's a sweet day personality and then the beast night personality #magiciantarot <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> LMAO WHAT so I thought the 3rd one was NTR and I was like "oh :/" but it turns out that uhh the guy has split personality #magiciantarot <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ LMAO steam sales are irresistible huh. I'll eagerly stalk your tweets whenever you get around to it /o/ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @yumette ahh yeah!! i was kind of disappointed they kept the anime art too. it's really odd seeing it in a game for some reason ww <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kiarosukuuro oh wow that sounds pretty serious ;;;; i hope you're downing some medicine too for it! <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> IT WAS TWO COCKTAILS LMAO my tolerance is not that weak seriously (I've def learned my lesson before on not to mix liquors) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> when I had two drinks and went to the bathroom one of them followed me and was like "are you gonna be okay? can you go down the stairs?" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> and make me drink more I just feel exhausted and irritable www don't worry I'm good though /o/ my friends are really protective <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm pretty certain I'm an angry drunk now because alcohol makes me really tired and if you don't let me sober up <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ but from time to time his voice drops and he says something scary only to be like "JK :))" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ he's super nice and adoring but secretly underneath... üî•üî• haraguro www so it's great because his tokuten scene is like sweet <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ I recommend it ;w;/ though he's not the main character (except for the tokuten) I LOVE this type of chara though <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @echostruck w w w I think they did a bit better with sawa's being introspection and the high priestess but ymmv LMAO <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @xBubbleTi well if you're wearing that then that means I'm okay wwww /o/ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @gensouojou just tried one and omg they're so good!! ty again jess ;w; they're just the right amount of sour and super soft/squishy too <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @echostruck maybe "sexuality" or something like that but ;;;; that's a pretty general and loose term/theme <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @echostruck w w w me too or at least for the first one. i looked up the empress meaning and all i got out of it was like "fertility, nature <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> meaning i have to go out like this into 5 degree weather with slight rain... y... olo...? IT'S OKAY. I'M CANADIAN. TOTALLY OKAY. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> uhhh. UHH. i can't wear a jacket with the clothes i have on because it makes me look like a snowman. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ the only other CD he's used this kind of voice is adventure kindan in his tokuten which is like my absolute favorite ww <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ LMAO YEAH manaka's performance is definitely A++++ all the time and i looove the tone he uses here. much lower <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @xBubbleTi PL EASE i don't know if dark grey + black even works but it's too late now wwwww <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ... but things just got progressively worse until i gave myself raccoon eyes and had to start all over again wwww <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> anyone who can do even eyeliner stuff is a god in my eyes. LMAO i was in a rush and figured "hey i've got this" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> How do you coordinate clothes again I'm ?????? https://t.co/cH3ZiyCCw3 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @riajuunibyou @aeducan caveat being that it's done well and it's not like an action movie thing where the romance is a subplot and reward <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @riajuunibyou @aeducan tbh when a game (or anything) has a romantic plot or option i'm 10000x more invested in the story |D;; <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @riajuunibyou @aeducan YAAAAAAAAS i joke a lot about "trashy romance novels" but seriously they're good for the soul sometimes www <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ there's surprisingly a lot of talking. and not the dirty kind of talking www <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ like the guys have this do-s confident voice tone so that's A++ for me but the scenes themselves aren't very interesting ;;; <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ It's... hmm.. original www i'm not really sure what i was looking forward to from the series tbh so i'm kind of like ??? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ from what I remember high priestess is all about introspection and self-understanding etc etc so this guy's CD was all about Ëá™Ë∫´„ÅÆËß£Êîæ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ more like I think the supposed meaning of the tarot forms the theme/obsession of the guy <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ well in this CD you're certainly /doing/ some tarots--- LMAO that was a bad joke <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @gensouojou !!!! I got your present ;3; thank youuuu (so tempted to just start eating them all straight away ww) https://t.co/5wdRJcQLb2 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ RIGHT? I'm like mentally trying to conjugate and form the sentence but then the moment is passed ww <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> the irony is that I have the highest affinity with the high priestess card too www I always get that with tarot quizzes #priestesstarot <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> what also makes me laugh awkwardly was that some of his points hit close to home ;;;  #priestesstarot <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> so much talking though with hard to understand words LMAO it was like psychology and brain terms everywhere #priestesstarot <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ...... so um wow yeah that "„ÅÑ„ÄÇ„Åë„ÄÇ" line all the reviewers were talking about was üí¶üí¶üí¶üí¶üí¶ #priestesstarot <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @yui_narita but there's no explanation of it or many sample sentences at all ;;;; it's all just for the plain "kashira" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @yui_narita sorry ;A; but when you find out what it's for can you let me know too? www I thought the entire phrase was like an idiom or smth <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @yui_narita ;;;; i'm afraid i don't really know the use of Êâã„Åã„Åó„Çâ _(:3/ so i'm having difficulties translating this too <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> did he get caught? are they searching for the missing heroine??? so many mysteries www #empresstarot <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> it's 2am okay I'm not cut out for analyzing what this means and there are police sirens at the end of the last track #empresstarot <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> the heroine locked /him/ up L M AO and broke him so ??? somehow the obsession carried over to his next life?? I think?? #empresstarot <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> what even LOL in the flashback track which I think is half what happened at the beginning and half their past reincarnations #empresstarot <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> so I'm getting like bits and pieces told backwards through flashback and monologues?? reincarnation may be involved too ww #empresstarot <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> the story is disorienting (what story ili plz admit this is just questionable trash ww) because you're thrown into the middle #empresstarot <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @riajuunibyou well actually the cage is in his basement LMAO so I guess it's a cage-dungeon date //bricked <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @tsukinohanshin YEAH PRETTY MUCH ww extreme escalation and logic leap. we have a real crazy here |D <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> how does a house visit lead to cages omg guy please #empresstarot <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> "You happily came over to my house, so why did you refuse to enter this cage" LMAO UHHH his logic is extremely questionable #empresstarot <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> also tagging all my reading of this novel with #lightbeyond so people can block it if they want! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Duo and Yodel (??)... I'm pretty sure these people didn't exist in the web version ww #lightbeyond <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @poundofsun95 i say that as if i have a huge pile of previous LNs to compare it too but I've only read like.. 10 www <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @poundofsun95 yeah! the only other LN i've found enjoyable is Ëª¢ÁîüÁéãÂ•≥„ÅØ‰ªäÊó•„ÇÇÊóó„ÇíÂè©„ÅçÊäò„Çã„ÄÇit starts off comical but then gets really good /o/ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> google translate turns it to Assiut LMAO or there's a city in Egypt called "Asyut" which can also be romanized as „Ç¢„Ç∑„É•„Éº„Éà apparently so ??? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> alright guys it bothers me that i still don't know his name really LMAO it's „Ç¢„Ç∑„É•„Éº„Éà so would the romanization be... Ashuto? Ascht? Asht? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @poundofsun95 for me what sells it is the main guy who starts off hating the "priestess" but is v. mature and responsible about it <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @poundofsun95 heroine great! she's doing her best and is willing to take advice from others but still tries to keep to her principles <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @poundofsun95 one of my pet peeves with LNs is when the characters are like flat 2D tropes and the setting is comical but i found the <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @poundofsun95 i really like it! i read up to chapter 30 or something on the web version _(:3/ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> instead i'm just reading it the vertical lines at 90 degrees..... ili you dumbass <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> i need to get used to reading vertical stuff ;;; i keep tilting my head as if that'll magically makes things horizontal <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ yeah! makes sense since it is a published version and they probably did like a final edit kind of thing to polish it up for sale ww <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> there's frequent illustrations too *A* https://t.co/Km7VyNAwCe <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ apparently there are changes in the published version so i wanted that too ww <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ YEP that's why I went out and bought the books after reading half of the web version :'D <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @Waganohara hmm best way to explain it is probably how people use hugs? for me it's like scent-taking = hugging ww that kind of reassurance <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Waganohara not really! it's just to (re)familiarize myself with them and it's just soothing and reassuring if i like them xD;; <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> *stares out the window* that was bad wording. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> btw wHEN I SAY SAMPLE I MEAN MENTAL SAMPLE. NOT LIKE. ARTICLES OF THEIR CLOTHING OR SOMETHING. LMAO <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Waganohara w w w I DON'T MINGLE MY SCENT WITH THEM!! i just... take a sample and store it as an "oh yes it's you" scent www <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @echostruck i was secretly judging you all-- jk jk i don't like too harsh citrus smells either but oranges seem to have a sweet-ish smell <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @riajuunibyou :(((( can't i at least be a canine? i prefer dogs over cats-- //bricked <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Ilinox 13) i have extreme social anxiety but i've gotten therapy for it ww and developed workarounds which may or may not be healthy <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @Ilinox 11) i sleep with a night light uwu (i don't need it but i'm used to it so) and i also have glow in the dark stars on my ceiling! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Ilinox 10) i had SO many plushies when i was young (covered half my bed) but the thought of spiders scared me so plushies are packed now <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Ilinox 9) okay something non-wild. i love oranges and the smell of oranges esp the scent of having peeled one. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @echostruck ??? aurora bites you all the time? www i don't know if this implies i'm like a kitten or <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @yumette now i'm an old granny yelling at kids on her lawn ww //bricked I LIKE TO FORGET MY WILD PAST EVERY HAPPENED (ÂøÉÂ∫ï„Åß„ÅäÂ¨¢Êßò„Å†„Åã„Çâ„ÉºÔºâ <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @riajuunibyou i was top dog at my school okay &gt;:( <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @riajuunibyou oh just because i didn't go out of my way to beat people up does not mean that i wouldn't defend myself... violently ww <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Ilinox 7) i loved to play "animals" as a kid and it took me a VERY long time to learn that no ili biting people is not appropriate <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @riajuunibyou and not to hold people to their mistakes from the past if they're honest about changing ww i mean i hope i'm not a bully now <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @riajuunibyou yeAH ww it's def not a side i'm proud of but it's also given me a really good experience of "ppl can change from their past" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @echostruck that's a good question ;; i def wouldn't recommend ppl who need scientifically proven sleep to try it out (like babies LOL) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @echostruck no worries!! i read so much on it i'm glad i can dispense my experiences and knowledge on it LMAO <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @riajuunibyou but i was too fast for anyone so... it was kind of like a mocking hell during recess for them ;;;; and then i'd return it <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @riajuunibyou so no point. it was more like i really loved playing tag. so i'd steal people's things and get them to try and chase me <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @riajuunibyou LMAO i never shook people down for lunch money because everyone had packed lunches those days or cafeteria meal plan <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @echostruck or screw up your schedule |D;; and have to somehow fix it <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @echostruck if you miss your scheduled nap time then.. you'll be feeling REALLY crappy and you either have to last to your next one <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @echostruck and so i'm like a well-rested person for 4-5 hoursish but then you NEED to nap or else you'll start to crash <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @echostruck you also train yourself to sleep when it's nap time ww so mine was actually 24 min &lt;-- my optimal non-groggy wake up <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @echostruck and in the process you learn the rough min you need in a nap to feel good. too much and you'll get groggy. too little = tired <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @echostruck really rested actually! you have to ease yourself into polyphasic sleeping (so i started cutting down from 6 hrs to 3 hrs) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> omg i thought i was almost at the end of my likes but then i see you guys piled on more *squints eyes* <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @echostruck aka: it was rough on me because my summer was spent lazing around reading VNs which would... start making me sleepy ww <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @echostruck also you need to be really strict and like gungho about getting up out of your nap. so it helps to be excited about something <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @echostruck wwwwww ngl i was reminded of that when talking to you <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @echostruck because i would need to nap for 30 min spaced throughout the entire day. like once around 1:00PM then next would be 5:00PM etc <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @echostruck I concluded that it was pretty amazing having 19 hours in a day to do things LOL but that the world isn't very accommodating <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Ilinox 6) one time my family bought two "girl" hamsters but turns out they weren't and we ended up with a family of hamsters <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @echostruck @shinkaiism phew ww no unexpected kittens from kittens any time soon then-- <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Ilinox 5) i spent three months of my summer one time surviving off of 3 hours of sleep every day (project on polyphasic sleep) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ i don't remember signs or streets but i have good instincts + landmark recognization ww so half-bad and half-good?? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Ilinox 4) hometes make me so very very very happy bc i have low self-esteem. and my "thank you!" response is crap at conveying that _(:3/ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @aeducan @shinkaiism translator spends translating your thing. you're paying for the X years of experience they have in translating etc etc <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @aeducan @shinkaiism this reminds me of that art post i saw going around recently too ;; like you're not just paying for the time the <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Ilinox 3) on a school field trip to the mountains i separated from the group and got lost LOL but managed to find my way back <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Ilinox 2) i've kept my hair short for the past 5 years because i'm too lazy to manage long hair <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Ilinox 1) in elementary school i was a bully ;;; pretty sure it was because i was simultaneously teachers' pet so i got away with things <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @echostruck @shinkaiism not sure if he's neutered (and aurora isn't spayed yet right?) www or they're both kittens so it'll be AOKAY <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @echostruck @shinkaiism *crosses fingers* oh but that reminds me that you said aurora was going into heat soon, will that be okay with him? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @undiscord hoping to get some dirt on me? |D;; <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @gensouojou i thought she was trying to say sabbath ww did they manage to preserve the joke while translating it still? impressive! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> aww you guys are having so much fun i want to join in |D;; (gives me something to take a break from work on) https://t.co/rJJNXYA3t9 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @riajuunibyou @shinkaiism 1$ per min of the track or 1$ per min of the time she spends? cause that'd be nice for the latter lmao <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @echostruck are you gonna lay off on any names until you're sure he'll get along? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @echostruck OH now i feel bad ww it looked like he had hooded eyes |D;; but i hope he gets along well with your hime <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @echostruck !!!!! he's got a bedroom eye stare--- //bricked <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @riajuunibyou @shinkaiism maybe if they actually paid nee-chama 20$/hr she spends working on it :') <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @riajuunibyou @shinkaiism considering translating 10 min of a drama CD actually takes around 2-3 hours... wwww <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> and they didn't BOOOOOOOOOO it just cuts into the japanese audio <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> i keep on accidentally clicking dance with devil DUBS rather than SUBS so i caved to curiosity to see if they had dubbers singing <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ //pats ;w; if only there was a way to check secondhand shop inventories too like traders rather than just auctions <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ because if i trigger my OCD it'll be the end of my life in wanting to complete my collection |D;; <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ hmm honestly i'm not too crazy about collecting tokutens ww or more like I've desperately averted my eyes and mind from the thought <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ slammed us all with 2 hours of wasurenagusa (i still shake my head when i think about how they had to use TWO CDs ww) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ yeah ;; it definitely feels a bit short but then i also think how that used to be what drama CDs were like until Rejet <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ yeah! it's kind of like rejet's dear vocalist or seventh heaven (but much shorter) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ it's not R18 though :'D so it's very innocent even if the titles seem very suggestive www just cute kisses (BUT MANAKA SOOOO...) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ they're just really random situational stuff ww as you can see from the short description. i have the uhh bedroom one--- LOL <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Familiar** holy crap not similar. similar to what? ili control your english <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> OH MY GOD I WAS WONDERING WHY HE SOUNDED SO SIMILAR YOO @SoMuchCatfood @xBubbleTi https://t.co/zkGmYGlIaP :'DD <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> *clenches fist* i love ballads so much <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> speaking of which who had a Hanae bias on my TL again because? https://t.co/smLUDE5LCk ohhhhhh this is so nice <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ i'm so embarrassed because i spent the entire drama CD going "man he has so much range i totally can't tell it's fukuyama!!" www <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ o////o https://t.co/tBeJJbhTiH i already have one of them haha but my manaka bias demands more s obs <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @jilatlanun SAME I expected a locked room, some noncon??, crazy evil laughter and monologue but nahh <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @jilatlanun that makes so much more sense www because fukuyama doesn't do many if any R18 CDs right? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @1_618lol ahhh thank you!! WWWW no wonder this guy doesn't sound the same <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @jilatlanun all this time I was going "man are my ears that bad that I can't tell this guy's voice apart in different places??" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @jilatlanun omg thank you NO WONDER THEY DONT SOUND THE SAME LMAO <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Fukushima Jun voiced Mizuchi right? I must not remember his voice at all because every time I listen to him he does NOT sound the same ever <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ same same!! collecting tokutens is so hard ;;; *stares sadly at this one cd which I want all tokutens but don't want to buy it 3x* <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ the country also loved his older bro so he's compared to him a lot etc etc almost Mejojo inferiority complex LMAO <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ kind of a sad story about him wanting her to see him for himself and not look for similarities between him and his bro <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ yeah the actual series ends happily and there's a happy tokuten 3 years later with kids then this tokuten as a "what if" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ the younger prince marries her when he ascends the throne ww <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ oh no the entire premise is that she has to marry the younger prince (when she was engaged and in love to the older one who died) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> what cracks me up is... I listened to the good ends BEFORE this and all he needed to do was give her time LMAO so it's like wow chill man <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> then he has a despairing / agonized monologue "this is the ONLY way for me to love you. every night I kill myself and become Claus" wow <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ LMAO they come to me I swear!! I was taken aback by the creepy dark turn in the tokuten <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> "why would I wear such annoying things. I have business to attend to. I'll see you at dinner" all cold and stuff <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> obv he's already left and acts like he's just seeing her in the morn and is like "you want to see my hand? go ahead. ring? I hate rings" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> as himself his voice is very low and stern (as his older brother it's very soft and higher) LMAO so fianc√©e asks to see his hand in the morn <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> omg the ending monologue is so tragic (I knew he changed his voice but you don't hear how much of a contrast it is until the end) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @aeducan tsuioku fianc√©e I believe from the new company mitsuhana (iirc) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> so like ??? is she fooling herself?? and does she actually know?? meanwhile he's so intent on the charade LMAO <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> But then the fianc√©e nearly calls him by his actual name (the younger brother) but he's like "no say my name it's Claus [older bro]" LMAO <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> THIS IS SO MESSED UP "touch me like you used to [touch my brother]" then he nearly gives himself away cause he's like "???? nails?? naughty" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> and in the dark of the night HE DIGS UP HIS BROTHER'S COFFIN TO STEAL A RING (that fianc√©e gave) and sneaks into her room at night I'M-- <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> BUT ONE OF THE TOKUTENS involves a "what if" of the fianc√©e not accepting the king's confession etc or returning his feelings <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> some drama about his inferiority complex and always having loved the fianc√©e in the past etc they get over it happy end <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> UH so I'm listening to this drama CD that had a pretty solid premise of a king marrying his dead older brother's fianc√©e <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @xBubbleTi https://t.co/O5EJ2o5mRP GET HYPED WITH ME!! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> In my defence there's apparently a big change between the web version and the books!! and illustrations!!! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> *closes eyes* I just put 3 volumes of this LN in my FJ cart... there's no turning back from this www <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> we're getting a little heavy handed on the symbolisms here ww LOOK A SPROUT SYMBOLIZING NEW BEGINNINGS AFTER THE RAIN SHOWER <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> all you can do is just not get impatient. and never give up. just keep trucking along and working determinedly at what you want to achieve <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> basically everyone struggles with questions like "why are we here" and breaking things is easy but repairing things is hard <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> i'm laughing but this message is so good from mysteriously random wisdom-dispensing old man gardener LM AO <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ it looks it up for you so you still learn www just you don't have to do the C+Ping https://t.co/UgyfEKyUZP <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ I think it does a little bit if you really trust or like the translator |D;; ngl I'm always in awe of @shinkaiism translations <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> „ÄåÁßÅÈÅî„ÅåÈßÑÁõÆ„Åß„ÇÇ„ÄÅ„É©„Ç§„Éä„ÇπÊÆø„Å™„Çâ„Å∞‚Ä¶‚Ä¶„Äç  INIAS I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE SUGGESTING IT boooooooo BOOOOOOOOOOOOOO <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ so reading is muuuuuch smoother |D;; because whenever i come across kanji i don't know i just hover over it and learn a new one <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ I know how that feels haha but thank god for this chrome app called "rikaikun" it basically highlights words + translates <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ just reading it LMAO so i actually still read their newest update just to see their word choices :'D <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ haha that's true but i actually really like that translator |D;; their word choices are so good that i feel like i improve <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Ash is such a smart cookie. He's already figured out that the keywords are "I'll wait quietly until it's time" GO GO https://t.co/w1MYTHQHVh <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> i' msactually crying here guys LM AO i've been taken into the story _(:3/ oh my these guys' concern aHHH (someone kick that betrayers' ass) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> you guys need to understand. in all of the 33 chapters i've read so far. Ash has NEVER raised his voice. he's NEVER lost his cool <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Zeke: and i'm saying I want to know the reason as to why!!
Ash: I've told you I DON'T KNOW!
;wwwwwwwwww; <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Zeke: she was so energetic and now she's locked herself in her room. isn't it natural to want to know what happened?
Ash: she's depressed <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> now he's talking with his friends and Zeke is like "what's going on. she'll only talk to you and we're (the soldiers) are worried" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> it was just coincidence that god chose her and she's here. UGH THE PROSE HERE KILLS ME. AND THAT CONVO WITH THE MALE LEAD <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> so she can feel justified being in the priestess' body. but she basically thinks she's mistaken. betrayer was right. it was all Ëá™ÂàÜÂãùÊâã„Å™‰∫ã <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> no one cares for her. she's also like "he's right. what am i doing." and believes she tried so hard to get people to like her <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> and gist was like "yo if you're only here to take care of her body why are you doing/changing so many things" making heroine believe <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> okay so basically betrayer pointed out that he didn't ever believe in her words and actually thinks she's an evil spirit or some witch <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> she feels okay being around because he doesn't put on pretenses. bUT NO HEROINE. SHE'S JUST GONNA WAIT FOR THE END?? ;;;;;;;;;;;; ASH <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> this scene is so good but so sad. because he's made his dislike of the previous priestess so clear he's also ironically the only one <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> T_T GOOD GUY MALE LEAD. DESPITE HIM DISLIKING THE PREVIOUS PRIESTESS. HE'S SO NICE... er polite? business-like? secretly nice??? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> and there's still the "once you're time limit is up you're gonna die for real!" how are they going to solve that omg <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> (which... true we don't know if they're being honest. but does it matter? two lies make a--- no this isn't shinigami to shoujo stop) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> THANKS BETRAYER. LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE. and it's sad cause her maids are trying to cheer her up but everything's all like "what's the point" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> o u ch. the heroine is in a depression now and basically doesn't believe anyone cares about her and they're all just acting it out <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ (I don't have the patience to skim to see if something is interesting in Japanese because I read too slow/hurts my brain LOL) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ basically ww i ended up finding 3 sites that translate LNs and whatever they find interesting i just start reading the raws |D;; <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> because she's trying her best but most people still continue to think of the worst of her. they all think she's "acting nice" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> no actually i tried to be rational BUT I'M STILL SO PISSED it's 2 chapters of angst so far and i feel so bad for the heroine <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> (that's why you trust the male lead--- he's protected by plot shields----- w w w w) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> in all respect, his words make sense though. i just feel so bad for the heroine because he was her only confidante ;;;;; <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> i always leave my suspicions be) BUT DAMN YOU MISTER. WHY. THIS IS WHY I HAVE TRUST ISSUES. DAMMIT. you. betrayer. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> NO. BETRAYAL. OH MY GOD. what pisses me off was that I HAD SUSPICIONS... but i didn't want to be a pessimistic asshole (which is how <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ yeah i'm enjoying it quite a lot! i've been browsing a few LNs recently so I think I have a pretty average standard to judge by ww <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> everyone's like ?? heroine is also like !?!? but by the end (Zeke wins all matches) they got more comfortable with her instead of terrified <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> "aight everyone gets to fight me and whoever wins gets 10 days off. whoever loses has to teach the [heroine] how to use a sword" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> BUT AWWW Zeke is so great ;A; he's the vice-captain of the Holy Knight Order and took the heroine to see them training and was like <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> i don't know if a chapter is super long or my japanese reading speed is so slow but i'm surprised i've only finished 30/81 chapters <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @yesbunaga @jilatlanun holy shit i'm so glad you're okay ;;;;;;;;;; <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @aeducan LM A O my kind of man <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Ash: ..... what are you doing
Zeke: no, this is what inias did
Ash: ...... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> and takes Ash's hand in his and stares at him straight in the eyes "I'll protect you with my life"
Ash: ............... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Ash: Inias wasn't threatened into it was he?
Zeke: Nah, it didn't have that feeling
Ash: what was it like then?
ZEKE gets down on a knee <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> it's a guy "Inias (??)" who had his life ruined by the previous priestess but somehow seems to have fallen for the heroine?? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> and his friend is Zeke. they're talking about who to set as a bodyguard for the heroine because of this incident and Zeke is like "oh i know <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> this scene w w w so male lead's name is "Ash" (actually it's something longer but I'm not even going to try romanizing it. Ascht? Ashto??) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ mystery! ww the heroine is trying to figure that out too <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ https://t.co/TQkprSuHCf !! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ i have no idea ww that's the mystery. what exactly are they doing with her soul ww they say it's to "give her a rest" but ??? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> (I'm also going THOSE WORDS ARE SO COOL but clearly so painful to hear cause he despises the previous priestess soooo) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> what hurts me the most is how formal and indifferent he is despite how much he hates her (that's how u do it lbr) https://t.co/TOXqaqJu5N <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ this country is heavily reliant on their priestess btw terrible disasters happen if they don't have a marked priestess <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ so this angel was like "uhh do you mind taking over the priestess' body while God fixes/purifies her soul so we can shove her back" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ oh she died LOL was run over by a horse carriage. it just so happened that she died at the same time the priestess suicided <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> and he just is like "do you think that absolves you from the things you did? i will NEVER forgive you" om fg chill <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> throws even more drama because male lead and previous priestess obvs have some bad blood LMAO and heroine tried to tell him she has amnesia <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> oh yeah this country has a tradition of having the priestess marry the strongest holy knight (together they serve the king+country) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> cause it's like.. all this hatred they built up and you're just like ";; yooo that wasn't me ;;;;" except you can't tell anyone that <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I CAME IN HERE FOR LAUGHS. NOT THIS TRAGEDY. i love these stories though it's sad and funny to have a good person put in an evil body <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> woman must be punished for attacking the priestess. even if the main guy has to harden his heart and dirty his hands o m fg <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> everyone else who wants revenge on previous priestess will act up, so even if "she" was the one who screwd over that woman's life the <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> heroine is like "?? YOU CAN'T JUST KILL HER LIKE THAT" but then its explained that if they don't make an example of this girl then <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> because previous priestess tortured her fiance (for shits and giggles) and main guy is prepared to kill the girl for assaulting heroine <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> including the main guy LMAO fast forward to a scene in the streets were this girl throws a tomato at heroine and vows to kill her <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> !!!!! main guy appears again and the drama here is insane. basically previous priestess was an absolute dick to everyone and people hate her <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @aeducan ww i thought the art looks really familair too for some reason <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> OKAY IT'S EVEN WORSE. THE PREIVOUS PRIESTESS HAD A FREAKIN' "HOLY JAIL" CREATED to torture anyone who displeased her omfg <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @aeducan https://t.co/TQkprSuHCf !! i found the first two chapters interesting so now i'm reading the raw ww <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> and promised to release him after 3 months but it's now 4 months and the heroine is basically finding out how horrible she was ;;;; <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> these LNs always start off lighthearedly and then things take a dark turn ;;; the previous priestress threw this guy into jail just because <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ not too sure! i remember hearing it from someone but i never checked it out at the source |D;; <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> heroine is like ";;; that's impossible" buit he's like "eh it's practice since we can't let anyone else know you're not actually her" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> "when people come to you for a blessing say something like "how dare you speak to me scum" or "you dare come to me with THAT hair?" LMAO <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> so the priestess' foster father is the first to know the truth and is teaching heroine how to be the priestess and the LESSONS LMAO <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> can return the priestess' soul. but of course the priestess was a terrible lady who does the whole "HO HO HO" evil laugh <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> into their country's priestess (who committed suicide) and she has to act like the priestess for a year or so until God <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> oh crap i was going to try and be productive today but i got sucked into reading this LN where this commoner girl's soul is sent <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ i thought i heard something about the company going bankrupt or something though re: April ;;; <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ oh yeah! the art was kind of interesting looking (though their clothes are even more wth than amnesia ww) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @aeducan @Doropyan *waggles eyebrows* so marx-kamui and camilla-leon eh?? wwwwww <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I' M LAUGHING although for us it'd be more like marx @aeducan @echostruck https://t.co/1E5BlhZG5n <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @yui_narita BTW I FEEL SO BAD FOR MY VAGUE "iirc" i haven't used FJ in months after my last binge buys _(:3/ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @yui_narita or you should be able to tell them that you want it shipped to a different location <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @yui_narita oh, why not? D: they should ask for a re-confirmation of the shipping address iirc when you do the 2nd form <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @yui_narita ohh must be because of the upcoming holiday then ;;; i don't think there's a way to keep it there unless you want to pay fees <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @yui_narita as you don't pay 2nd one they'll keep it there. but the limit is 30 days before they start charging you extra for storage iirc <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @yui_narita hmm when they receive the item they should prompt you for a second payment right? (the shipping cost to you) and so long <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @SoMuchCatfood :') thank you for helping me build a tolerance to eye-lickers nora wwwwww <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> To no one's surprise probably I had a TG-related dream www <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ I wish www no I had it permed a while back so you're seeing leftover curls <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @riajuunibyou that wouldn't be better off shown with a stable (as much as possible LOL) mind interacting with people of his past + present <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @riajuunibyou we've seriously gone full circle and it's to show another growth to kaneki so I don't see why he'd have more inner struggles <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @riajuunibyou PLEASE w he's been impressing me with his plot decisions and symbolism so I'm holding faith that he'll let this dead horse lie <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> He should be good now right??? cause I don't want to see a "oh no suppress haise" side ;;;; #tearsforkaneki <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Like at the very beginning it was to accept his ghoul side, then tortured side, then suppressed actual kaneki side... #tearsforkaneki <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> thinking more on TG I hope that's the last arc or use of kaneki's MPD #tearsforkaneki <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @tsukinohanshin @riajuunibyou LMAO yeah... now I'm just gonna cry into my pillows comatose like tsukiyama (I took a nap earlier actually ;;) <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @riajuunibyou wait what LMAO was this in TG or are we talking about TG:RE because ??? there was the nutcracker... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @tsukinohanshin @riajuunibyou I don't think he's done a chapter that HASN'T ended on a cliff ww I binged 45~ chapters and it's 5am <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> because whatever you do you at least won't be a hot mess like kaneki L MAO (it takes monumental effort for that) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> you know TG (+ re:) is kind of inspiring and fills you with determination in a really really odd way <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @riajuunibyou it ends on a pretty bad cliffhanger though i think you might want to wait a bit |D;; <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @riajuunibyou yoo even my eye-gouging YA novel isn't as gory as TG www which already covered it 5 chapters back https://t.co/ho9NUWrFjx <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> another funny thing was "WE GOT KANEKI KEN BACK BUT AT WHAT COST" wwwwww <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> this scene is so powerful though because male lead is tossing it all away. yandere guy is freaking out #chaosbeauty https://t.co/4jbXFYGCzx <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> whenever i talk about this i also remember the ikki pool scene ww where orion is like "ARGH you think you're so cool? dammit cause you are!" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> like he's smug cause he knows he's confident in backing up whatever he says/does but not pretentious. bUT AT THE SAEM TIME IT's IRRITATING <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> i re-listened to a bit of the senpai part and i just realized HOW SMUG HE SOUNDS. goddammit characters who are the fine line of smug and not <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> you know that tumblr post about being so predictable in your character biases that you get angry at yourself? yeah that's me all the way <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ me neither which is why I've never been able to finish a kareshi igai cd ;;;; I didn't know this one would have a similar premise <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ but nothing dangerous happened? LMAO they just shared her... also kind of a :/ situation because heroine cheats on her bf w senpai <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ it was definitely a really great scene but the rest was eeeeh it was marketed as a "dangerous love triangle" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ I'm half n half because if they sound good I'll want more from them but there's no other CDs with them LMAO <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> of him very slowly taking off his jacket and necktie like dayum man that's some confidence you got there w w w w w <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> "if you're under the covers by the time I take off my jacket and tie, I won't lay a single hand on you" and you get to hear the SFX <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> but he's made it obvious that he likes you (so yea a kind of dub con situation ww) but he says this line which was like <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The CD itself was pretty boring but there was this one scene where the heroine is drunk and so senpai takes her to his home to sleep it off <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> He has such a smooth voice as the senpai character I'D CHOOSE HIM IN A HEARTBEAT W W W W like very drawling and calm/confident <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @riajuunibyou i'll say what i said in the game. "he started it" www ladies don't start fights, we just end them n_n <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @riajuunibyou usually the ones involving murdering or maiming people puts me in the minority LOL but uhh surprisingly 30%ish? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @riajuunibyou it switches a lot! i was the 10% for the first episode. kind of normalized by the second. third episode was 50/50 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @xBubbleTi not everyone has gorgeous legs like yours ;D wwwwwwww <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> it's always really cool to see what other people who've played the game choose though. are you with the majority or the 10% w w w <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @riajuunibyou but fortunately (unfortunately??) i'm super lazy and have a pretty thick skin so it'd take some extreme disrespect to anger me <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @riajuunibyou basically ww friends and immediate family. also i guess if extreme disrespect gets heaped on me i'll retaliate too <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> mine is pretty simple. i protect what's mine. and brutal retaliation if someone escalates the violence. who brings shotguns #bigbadwolf <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> telltale games always great in making you realize exactly where your life philosophies lie #bigbadwolf <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> everyone's getting on my case for killing tweedledum but yooooo he and his brother were shooting me with a shotgun #bigbadwolf <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I really really hope Bigby gets to show him what happens when you piss off the big bad wolf lmao #bigbadwolf <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> "You couldn't have known."
"I could've."
GIRL IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT ;A; that guy is just a sick bastard #bigbadwolf <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> But this convo with Snow White ouch ;;; "I just keep thinking back to all the moments he bumped into me or talked to me" #bigbadwolf <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> some creep was fantasizing over your partner and he was your boss. so satisfying to yell "I'M GONNA RIP HIM APART" tho tbh #bigbadwolf <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ... Ugh why is it this again. After watching Jessica Jones and then playing wolf among us was a bad idea #bigbadwolf <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @himepuff otsukare lore ;w; you deserve a small break before wading back into bug fixes and whatnot! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> This is why we're all friends on my TL isn't it? we all read sh[  ]ting sprees the same way w w w w <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ aww thank you ;3; I'm glad it's not annoying haha and that means I'm kind of using my Twitter for good right? ww advertising <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @xBubbleTi it'll definitely be some great stress relief ww <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @xBubbleTi oooh you're resuming fencing again? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> normally I REALLY REALLY hate that trope but it was well done here. they kind of paused. and then continued thier job #closeyoureyes <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> earlier when both he and the heroine were sharing binoculars and turned to talk to each other resulting in accidental kiss #closeyoureyes <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> about to say he still hasn't had his first kiss (total virgin here w w w) BUT THIS SCENE HAPPENED #closeyoureyes https://t.co/iscGIAykfa <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> but he faked a text from male lead to lead her out. so she's like "wait why'd you kiss me" and male lead defends himself #closeyoureyes <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> male lead's sister got attacked by the psychopath ;;; who used toma's method of forcing a sleeping drug down someone's throat #closeyoureyes <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> i'm honestly trying to stop watching because subs haven't caught up to episode releases but... every episode is a cliffhanger #closeyoureyes <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> i'm in visual delight. osanajimi has center stage in this episode interrogating all suspects in that uniform w w w #closeyoureyes <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> HOLD ON. HOOOOOLD ON. who gave the osanajimi new threads. he's looking mighty fine there #closeyoureyes https://t.co/sG7agpOP8I <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> how is this guy NOT buried in sexual harassment complaints holy. he takes a hair from the heroine and twines it on his finger and kisses it <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> so male lead TASERS THE GUY LM AO 3 times and is "just tell him you tasered him accidentally" that was petty revenge admit it #closeyoureyes <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> but they're like "oops kind of a mistake and no evidence" so they have to leave but heroine has to stay #closeyoureyes <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> and so he starts feeling up the heroine in the dark, she sets off distress signal, male lead comes in and sedates the guy #closeyoureyes <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> this guy who i had my main suspicions on WAS as much of a creepy pervert as he was (show makes him out to be a murderer too) #closeyoureyes <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> he's like "you want me to imagine you in those dresses? sorry, i can't do that. try them on and show me" wwww #closeyoureyes <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> she doesn't know what to wear so asks the male lead's opinion and shows him 5 diff dresses on hangers #closeyoureyes <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> so i don't know if this is a smooth line or not but the heroine is going undercover to a party to investigate #closeyoureyes <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> osanajimi is always a step behind ;w; he tries to prepare safety measures for heroin but nope male lead already has #closeyoureyes <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> "when are you going to introduce me to her?" wwww i love old friends who know each other so well #closeyoureyes <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> oh snap he just got profiled by a US profile specialist (female colleague of his in the past) "microexpressions have changed" #closeyoureyes <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> in this case it's my favorite locked room scenario and someone is dead so who dunnit wwww #closeyoureyes <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> these cases are actually so much fun because he encourages the heroine to go through steps and criminal psych/profile #closeyoureyes <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> the osanajimi is too kind. help. i still ship the main pair but i want this guy to be happy wah #closeyoureyes <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> "if... look... we've been good friends since childhood. if you're happy, no matter what it is, i'll support you." ;A;!!!! #closeyoureyes <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> his before/after face kills me. it's like "!! what metaphor is she gonna use for me?!" to "..... -_-" #closeyoureyes https://t.co/2LFsTQ7n6o <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> "a labrador with pride and arrogance" GIRL LM AO THAT'S MEAN. he just stares at her for a good 2 min (kind of intimidating) #closeyoureyes <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> hmm. an emotionless robo------ LMAO sorry sorry. cold wind. light rain. thunderstorm/ozone? www that's what i'd use #closeyoureyes <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> after they discuss the case there's this long silence before the male lead "... what metaphors would a woman use for me?" #closeyoureyes <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> they're solving another case and reading a suicide note where this woman describes a man she likes with "light, clear spring" #closeyoureyes <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> he LP the slow burn of this romance is killing me with how cute it is ahhhhhhh i love how mature the heroine is #closeyoureyes <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> uh oh www of course it turns out the male lead is talking about his pet turtle rolling around but that misunderstanding w w w #closeyoureyes <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> [saleswoman trying to sell a bed to male lead]
"so even if you roll around on it it won't break?"
[she looks at heroine" #closeyoureyes <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ y... yes and he's slender (then again basically all the main male actors are) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> amendment: he only understands serial killers as a profiler ww but oh man why is he so attractive. why is everyone attractive #closeyoureyes <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> "Zhi Yu was right."
"About what?"
"That I don't understand women and never will" L OL boy you don't understand anyone #closeyoureyes <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> cause he was dissing her job (to try and get her to continue working for him) and he shut up instantly cause she's right LOL #closeyoureyes <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> and both leads are mature and great. the heroine just indirectly called the male lead an elementary kid being jealous #closeyoureyes <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> i'm really enjoying this cdrama ww they stuck quite closely to the parts of the book i've read with only cosmetic changes #closeyoureyes <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> and the heroine's lil sis is like "OH GOD HE LOOKS SO HANDSOME" d y ing. he's a germaphobe too btw #closeyoureyes https://t.co/6qTPg0bH7Z <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> so heroine calls him back when the fireworks are going off and obvs when the guy turns he's silhouetted by fireworks #closeyoureyes <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> and there's a scene where they light fireworks and everyone runs back but the male lead is like standing close to it still #closeyoureyes <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> and he's actually half-kind to her when he usually doesn't know how to talk to people. aka: he responds to her hello. #closeyoureyes <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I LOVE THE HEROINE'S LITTLE SISTER. I'M LAUGHING. she's so unashamed of showing how hot she thinks the male lead is ww #closeyoureyes <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> i'm laughing because the male lead didn't do anything but just stop the swing. it was the heroine beating the killer up #closeyoureyes <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> male lead got there in time to grab the stick. giving heroine another opportunity to just sock the guy in the face LMAO #closeyoureyes <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> teamwork omg. heroine just clocked the killer in the head with a stick. and then when he grabbed it to attack the heroine #closeyoureyes <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> except also super lazy. uh. will graham? without the empathy though??? will graham and sherlock mix?? #closeyoureyes <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> he sounds like he's saying something romantic there but his EQ is so low it's nonexistent. basically a chinese sherlock #closeyoureyes <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> dammit that white shirt looks so good on him wwww here's the male lead #closeyoureyes https://t.co/xVKN9ntJSB <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> there's something really satisfying in creating a mind web or brainstorm cloud and physically pinning it on a wall for some reason <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> totally random but a friend and I joke that if we were to live together we'd have a covered wall a la psychopath or detective <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @daisypeony yep yep! It's called "Love me if you dare" but I like the novel name better ww "he's here, close your eyes" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> oh wait that was Andy LM AO okay i take that back. clever use of modern pop culture AND you fit in a BGM #closeyoureyes <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> oh come on chinese dramas you can do better than ripping off an ost STRAIGHT from sherlock #closeyoureyes <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> i really hope he doesn't turn out to be a LI either though because the two osanajimis have a great platonic relationship #closeyoureyes <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> he's so adorable hel p. this is the osanajimi police officer w w w #closeyoureyes https://t.co/j2yKeQPO5o <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> i don't think he's the second male lead (author doesn't usually write love triangles) but he sets the screen on fire every time he appears <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> this is odd but i'm watching a cdrama about criminal profiler and yooo the male lead is pretty attractive BUT THE OSANAJIMI!! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @echostruck oh no ;;; i hope time solves this! i guess it's not possible to return the older cat if it doesn't work out? (not fair either w) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @echostruck princess!! &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 how is she getting along with the older cat? ;w; <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> not that... it uhh justifies anything... you know. just someone called her a bitch. so i ripped their arm off as retaliation :'D #bigbadwolf <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> WHAT. NO. OH MY GOD. ???????? who's going to be my moral compass now? I /ripped/ someone's ARM OFF FOR HER LM AO #bigbadwolf <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> there was so many good options there I nearly missed my chance lmao I was like "DO I SAY YOU TOO? THANKS??" #bigbadwolf <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> She's basically good cop and I'm bad cop lmfao
"I... just... Be careful, please."
"Always." #bigbadwolf <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> (that was almost word by word of my dream presentation introducing the topic LOL) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Primal being the word for instinct etc our lizard brain and "eau" being French for water but also used as part of the word for perfume <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I woke up after I introduced my topic and so I don't remember much except it was about scents I think and instinct? Term was "primaleau" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> also my professor was HOT AS HELL w w w w school board member was attractive too but kind of antagonistic so www <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> it was a lecture hall of like 200 people ;;; but uhh surprisingly I was doing pretty good. really chill and interactive <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> one of the* so I had to do this presentation on a topic we were researching (graduate thesis) to determine if I'd get kicked out or not <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> And of the school board members wanted to kick me out (with my delinquent group I guess. sorry we were a small group iirc among normal ppl) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ;;;; I fell asleep again and had one of the most oddest dreams. I was at some boarding school? felt like a uni for delinqents <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> so more "what is even going on" than anything else which is nice www since I don't need to wake up creeped out |D <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> to absolutely no one's surprise (re: my own) I dreamt about kilgrave's powers :s it was all really disconnected and disjointed though <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @echostruck I feel like a child with limited vocab www aka lions would be hairy cats and tigers are line cats and leopards are dot cats <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> not.. technically.. wrong.. but english ili english. smashed stones = rubble sooo use proper words ww not stone smash <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> sometimes i read the meaning of the kanji wrong and it gets stuck in my head ;;; so i keep reading Á†ïÁü≥ as "stone smash" which is <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @yui_narita that's smart! i hope you get it or if you're secretly hoping for someone to take the temptation away i hope that happens too? ww <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @yui_narita hmm i don't think i'd worry much about anyone outbidding you! i wouldn't set the max bid high but it's up to you |D;; <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @yui_narita when you win** is what you want to buy off auction really popular? like are there bids on it already? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @yui_narita nothing! ww iirc you only need to pay them if you win because then you're actually buying something <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @yui_narita but there's still a chance in that 5 min for someone to outbid you (or if someone else snipers with a higher max bid) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @yui_narita and they'll do it for you within the last 5 minutes so you don't have to stay up at a ridiculous hour if it ends at one <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @yui_narita it's been a while since i last used it but i think you set what you want to bid and the maximum you're willing to bid? ;; <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @yui_narita (unless there's like a special promo or something going on somewhere!) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @yui_narita yeah i think i only used amiami once and it was okay but i mean FJ can do it too so ww i just decided to keep it all on one site <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @yui_narita for auctions are FJ ;; for proxy buying stuff I've used amiami, yesasia, treasure japan, and amazon JP but I like FJ's cleanness <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @yui_narita aw no i'm just answering questions ;3; feel free to ask me anything at any time! but yeah the only things i've really used are <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @yui_narita hmm, i'm not too knowledgeable on this ;; i've always used FJ cause they have a nice sniper bid option but I can ask! ww <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> i know it's super messed up and she doesn't want to tell luke but COME ON NOTHING EVER GOOD COMES FROM WITHHOLDING INFORMATION #JJ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @yui_narita like buying things off of auctions? or you mean auctioning your own stuff? :o <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> sometimes i can't tell if things are falling apart or not ;A; can't tell if her rage is her coping or if it's part of the healing proces #JJ <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ b UT WHY SHU dammit toriumi give me a reason to dislike your voice for real-- wwww <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> trying to protect everyone she cares about and sometimes it's KG sometimes it's just other humans being gross humans #JJ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> this show places you in jessica's shoes and makes it so frustratingly good because you really feel her struggle #JJ <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @himepuff it's always a trip to listen to it says its own name too ww WAS NOT EXPECTING SUCH A LOW VOICE AND DEADPAN DELIVERU <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> like in Japanese it probably wasn't intended to have any other meaning but with the english connotations (esp with tumblr language uh) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> :// i see where they're going with this https://t.co/OnfjpprsxV but it kind of gives off the wrong sense <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> and then proceed to stare at us like sideshow entertainment or something. uhhhhhhh excuse me i know english may be fascinating but please <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> uhh while tennant's acting is A+++ i think the article misses that the point that fangirls piled onto loki because of his past <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> i remember reading this article about how tennant's acting will put his villain on par with ones like hiddleston's loki etc etc but <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ChromsSleeve SERVES HIM RIGHT FOR THAT RIDICULOUS ONE-SLEEVE FASHION KGHJKFSGH (my eyes keep getting drawn to the hip line i--) <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ Oh yeah ;;; there's definitely pros and cons for either option. Having to translate what's going on slows me down SO much <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ i think i linked you one of their songs! poker face by takeuchi ryota? |D;; <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @yukiruyume but i noticed quite a few included "amnesia" in there and was amused but realized on second thought that it was pretty good! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @yukiruyume ww just basically the only JP reviewers opinions that i'll consider are those who have KgK, HA, CZ, or StS as „Åä„Åô„Åô„ÇÅ„Ç≤„Éº„É†ÔΩì |D;; <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @gensouojou same same! ww my posts go StaSky &gt; StS &gt; Amnesia wwww <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ seiyuu covering famous vocaloid songs basically! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ it's also kind of why i started up a blog to force me to cover ALL routes or i'd have half-completed games everywhere <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ two routes wwwww so no i didn't. i just did the ones i was interested in and then my motivation plummeted <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ LOL, right? I was thinking the same and then I heard his song in the ACTORS CD and I was like "dammit okay fine" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> oh woah i just realized if you look at my post history on my blog i actually played Shinigami to Shoujo BEFORE Amnesia ;;; surprising <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ I did one route in Hakuouki and two routes in Bloody Call before really tackling Amnesia |D;; although.... wait a second <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ yeah, same! or well more like it was my first fully completed otome game where i understood 70% all by myself LMAO <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ "I love you.................... my dog" Ôºà‚ïØ¬∞–î¬∞Ôºâ‚ïØÔ∏µ ‚îª‚îÅ‚îª <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> thinking back on it i'm going to change my score for the first game www because it was really clever and YEAH. IKKI. //bricked <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> quite a few of them added Amnesia in as well and whenever I think back on it... i did... like it quite a bit! especially for it's time <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> i've noticed something among the BAW reviewers that i looked at ww like among the giants of KgK, CZ, (then HA and StS) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ LMAO that's true although at the time i was so taken aback by actually getting vocals that i was like "yo stop the monologue" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> this song makes me want to cry immediately https://t.co/vUP8w7CoXy whenever i hear it. curse you rejet!! <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ i think i may have listened to a few of her wasurenagusa covers! (because Rejet refuses to release an OST ww) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ and I don't think he or Reiji got any speaking lines LM AO (i smell bias!!) but i love choruses so it was pretty awesome <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ the one you linked right? I did! although I kind of side-eye a few of their choices since Kanato sings in a different register <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> and people wish Gas Mask-sensei had a route LOL meanwhile gameplay system is veeeeery simple and overall seems a bit short <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> looked around at like 5 different reviews of BAW so far though and the sentiments are that the sub characters are REALLY nice www <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> hrmm does anyone remember the japanese reviewer that @yukiruyume was looking at? @Doropyan @jilatlanun <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> lovey-dovey speech and then at the end when you think they might secretly slip in an endearment... NOPE "dog" and "slave" e_e <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm reminded of my utter scream of rage though with his and Hijikata's wasurenagusa CD though because they always do this kiiiind of <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Guy... that's not how it works lmao "I won't ever see you as a human or person. You'll always be my slave and possession" #Rejet3K <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Always quietly amused at zhuge liang's volume. He teaches you to be a man eater but falls in love instead :'D <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @danderedere but the first isn't so bad! it was a situation of the guy wanting to use the heroine as a seductress against enemies wwww <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @danderedere I don't believe the entire series is sadistic (then again I kept falling asleep and never went past the third volume) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @danderedere Rejet's 3 kingdom series ww specifically "Sou Sou" or "Cao Cao" whichever name you know him best by |D <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> "I love this woman because... she accepted me to the point of taking my brand. Will your daughters?" took advantage what an a-hole #Rejet3K <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @aeducan SERIOUSLY the way he plays the people at the banquet (and by extension the listener) ugh Mitsu our trash biases are too charming <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @aeducan it's amazed all over again at how good this CD is at pushing you to the brink of hating him then giving fun scenes like this ww <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> this scene is amazing tho his allies (?) are mad but he's like "I'm afraid if one of you took her I'd have to wage war on you all" #Rejet3K <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> "Oh I'm sorry I'm just /so/ in love with my beloved wife that I won't consider any other women. She's so /delectable/" WHAT A LIAR #Rejet3K <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> the list continues on. 1) purposefully kicks her food over 2) near drowning by sake 3) branding 4) mocking and many threats ww #Rejet3K <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Everyone holds DiaLov up to be the most terrible and abusive game but you know... from now on I'm just gonna hold up this guy's drama CD ww <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> h e lp I remember why I love his CD so much despite wanting to flip my own tables at how terrible he is. HE'S SO AWFUL #Rejet3K <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> "The one who owns and controls you. Who is that? The person above you that is the absolute being. Who is that?" #Rejet3K <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> "Your meals are at my feet and on the ground. It's an honor for you to eat at the same time as me. Be thankful" i love this trash #Rejet3K <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> BUT he threatens to throw heroine to be used by his soldiers, takes away her name, and boot licking lmao HOW DOES THIS END AGAIN? #Rejet3K <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I must have mentally blocked how many things happen because all I remembered was like... boot licking #Rejet3K <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> in my case i'm too tired to do anything but tumble in bed... and make some headway with the jerk of wei wwww <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @_tigerine i wish she had been talking about amnesia dark descent lmao <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> i agree there's media there that fulfills those for both but it's just such a extreme simplification. men = protectors, women = nurturers <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> for example, she talks about male wish fulfillment in ordinary heroes getting harems = obvs ordinary girls getting all the guys <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> is it Ukyo?? but Ukyo is never painted as abusive. His alter-ego is just murderous and no where does the game/story allow that either <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> but Toma himself is super self-aware and criticizes his own actions. the game/story doesn't give him a pass on that omfg <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @riajuunibyou it was a petty thing done when i was younger ww but basically there was this guy who was kind of jealous of how close <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @aeducan i have to take a minute and be like "who is tha-- oh right" wwww <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @aeducan right?? tumblr is the worst because our handles are so different too, whenever i hear things like "blah blah prevolt" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @riajuunibyou nope ww i'll guiltily confess to actually using this to make other people jealous on purpose before too BWAHAHA <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> which is actually why when my bro's gf wanted me to call her "jiejie" i was like "eeeEEHHH ;;;;" cause i was familiarized with her name <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> TL;DR sorry guys but once you're stuck with a nickname or a name in my head. you're stuck stuck. IT WILL BE YOUR APPELLATION FOREVER <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> just thinking about being like "hey rin" makes me shudder uncomfortably. WHO IS THAT. WHO AM I TALKING TO www <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> now that i think about it ww same thing goes for nee-chama. there was SUCH a short transition from rin -&gt; neechama that it's stuck now <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @aeducan wait is that a good thing or a bad thing ww i don't remember how sassy little sisters act in cdramas |D;; <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> so it actually discomforts me physically to say his actual name www it's just so weird. makes me feel like i'm talking to someone else. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> funny thing. i don't have a problem remembering my brother's english name /BUT/ i never call him any term other than "gege" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> or wait. no my grandma's last name isn't her maiden name... it's my mother's maiden name. ohh i clearly don't understand how bloodlines work <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> but my grandma is always "grandma" to me so i just heard a family friend call her by maiden name + suffix and I was like "?????? WHO???? oh" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> i'm always like "who are you talking abo-- ohhh" except it's not that bad. i'm actually very familiar with my parents' chinese names <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> it's funny how titles or terms become a name in your head sometimes, like "mama" is always "mama" to me so when someone calls her by name <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @himepuff they never actually touched or talked about that LMAO he's just an up and coming vocalist competing with the others <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> but then he's overbearing in how he pretty much dictates everything when and where?? and stop pushing/pulling her everywhere #rejetvocals <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> and his confidence makes it so that he's also straightforward about how much he loves the heroine so that's good #rejetvocals <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ I can only think of like.. 2 things he's in that's non-r18 and otome ww but okitsu should have more normal ones! <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> i need to clarify that it was sfxes behind the scenes FOR MOVIES not uhh.. drama CDs www <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> because it was so H OR R E NDOUS SOUNDING... horrendous and yet so familiar *shudders at the squishing* <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> i remember watching this short clip on youtube about sfxs behind the scenes and they used this one with jello in a bucket and i just froze <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> i still recall inwaku's SFXs as being one of the hilarious terrible ones for a drama CD... W H Y THE PLUNGING <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @riajuunibyou @gensouojou @aeducan .... THANK YOU FOR RUINING MAC N CHEESE FOR ME FOR FOREVER. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ i'm a bit disappointed because i loved the twists/story of the first and second volume but this one is like "WTF IS GOING ON LOL" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> story husband's chapters are sadly kind of bland "and then one day a man, let's call him Y-kun, appeared" #madlove <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> the husband is hirakawa and he's using this calm cold voice AND IT'S TERRIFYing. like he's gonna stick a knife into you any sec #madlove <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> So I couldn't fall asleep on that note so I went to check out the husband and GIVE ME THE INCOMPETENT LOVER I THINK ;;;;; #madlove <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @tsukinohanshin gosh darn foiled by a lack of directions!! ww <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> no one would tell him where the other guy was or where she was being married and so. that was it. he missed his chance :'( #madlove <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I should let you know that apparently the day she was to be married he.... couldn't find her to take her away L M A O #madlove <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> What did he expect. I'm rolling my eyes SO HARD RIGHT NOW OH MY GOD. give me the husband right now this guy is incompetent #madlove <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> next track is another poem about him being sad at not having seen her for days TURNS OUT SHE'S BEEN CHAINED UNDERGROUND BY HUSBAND #madlove <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Quality poetry and DO YOU NOT THINK ABOUT HOW THIS'LL PISS HER HUSBAND OFF its not even subtle #madlove <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @jilatlanun l m ao my bad must be a really red / skin-colored lollipop considering he repeats those colours like twice---- <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> can't forget his "I loved you / I love you / the indecision of needing to stop / the chains of being unable to stop / ah" #madlove <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm not doing it justice but IF YOUR MIND WENT TO BLOWJOB THEN ding ding ding www #madlove <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> chapter 9 of this guy's poem. "Colour of skin / the sensation of a tongue / the sad colour of sky / a quiet calling voice" #madlove <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @jilatlanun poem guy's poems aren't very good either ww on one hand I'm glad because it's easy to understand on the other ITS SO BLATANT <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I can't take this seriously. Girl can't decide who she loves more so the guys are basically duking it out with their story/poem #madlove <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> and the heroine just gives him this look and he's like "oh I guess I'm doing the same" YEAH YOUR POEMS STARTED IT DUMMY #madlove <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> what cracked me up is poem guy being all like "I love you though!! leave your husband cause he writes nasty stories about you" #madlove <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> husband of the girl btw read the poem and wrote a popular book on her (and suspected affair) SO IT'S A MESS #madlove <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> which I get to hear interspersed in the tracks. (thanks Hana Awase my Japanese poetry skills are A++ though this is simple poetry) #madlove <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> and she had an affair with him on the day she married another guy?? Guy she had an affair with wrote this popular poem about her #madlove <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> metaphorically. It's such a mess from the get go. guy I'm currently listening to is her previous lover (ex-fianc√©??) #madlove <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> so catching up to the latest in kyouai catharthis and LOL?? two men and a woman trapped between them #madlove <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ I only like it as a subtle flavouring in cooking but not like a drink made out of it :x <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ lore says we have the same speech patterns which is kind of embarrassing ww <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @daisypeony omg did you recognize any words? ww it sure as heck wasn't mandarin <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @daisypeony they did ww i'm 90% sure that was cantonese or their attempt at it <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> i actually... really want this as a song somewhere now?? oh god it's so good https://t.co/rs1OcQNdnu <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> this careless whisper song has still been going. STILL GOING. IT'S BEEN 7 MINUTES. AND IT'S STILL GOING <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> lAUGHING BECAUSE I'M SCROLLING THROUGH TUMBLR and i encountered a photoset with the OTHER skeletonbro and "romantic background music" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> oh god 8-bit careless whisper is nEVER GONNA LEAVE MY HEAD NOW. NO <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @rabbitinwaiting @MissHainclaire ... S I LENTLY SC REAMS <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> L I N D O. YOU NEED TO CHILL. I think we all guessed that plot twist with the brother but i'm crying because he's so extreme #DwD <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @daisypeony RIP <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> when you try so hard to be a bad boy but instead you're a cutie pie. that's mage's description right? ww #DwD <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> "blow off those creeps; Rem, Urie, and Shiki" oh my god SOMEONE GIVE MAGE MUSIC LESSONS. HIS SONG IS CRACKING ME UP #DwD <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> c r y ing THE BEST BOY... he has a bald spot now #DwD https://t.co/9h3u9KoK2P <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> DID MAGE JUST BOOT DOWN A DOOR IN THE MIDDLE OF CLASS. there's being a delinquent and there's being a /delinquent/ wow #DwD <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @echostruck lore responded to a post with some points brought up here! https://t.co/ZS3BIJuU4P <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @yui_narita sweet sounds better than sour ;w;/ though i don't deal well with sweet things either. plums and i are doomed to not get along <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @yui_narita *sneaks you all my glasses of juice* it's the very sour-y kind.. i think? I didn't realize there's a bitter kind too D: <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ i don't think i'm brave enough to try drinking something with ginger in it though :x <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ i'm really liking the honey and lemon combo |D;; i've made that for myself a few times but i hear about ginger quite a bit! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> and no. i never did finish that second glass of plum juice. i knew when to throw in the towel before i wrecked myself <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> so life lesson. don't chug drinks you hate because you'll just get a refill. CHUG IT AT THE END BEFORE YOU LEAVE _(:3/ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> so i chugged it but because i chugged it so fast the hostess was like "oh you're done already. want a refill?" and blatantly ignored my NOs <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> i was visiting a relative with my dad and they gave me a glass of plum juice. BLECH. but i was too "polite" and didn't want to not finish <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> i have a very important lesson for all of you on my TL. this is also a very traumatic memory for me when i was a child <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> language barrier but i had an unsettling feeling and... turns out it's plum juice Œ£(–îÔΩÄ|||„Éé)„Éé I D E T E S T PLUM JUICE. OH GOD. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> my mother was talking about getting this drink to soothe our coughs and irritated throats and i wasn't understanding what it was because <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @shinkaiism i can't like or reblog this enough ww *queues it up again* <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @shinkaiism *gives you a microphone so you can continue schooling people on doing actual translations* wwww <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @echostruck @gensouojou while professionals have to deal with deadlines or being assigned projects they don't necessarily like or know <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @echostruck @gensouojou sometimes fan translations are the best at trying to enhance the original game and bring it over (SOMETIMES) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @echostruck @gensouojou so you purposefully make him more abrasive? what. why. WHY. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @echostruck @gensouojou what that guy is doing to make characters "interesting" is just... you subjectively think a reluctant hero is boring <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @echostruck @gensouojou yeah i want to sympathize because localizing to make things culturally appropriate must be really hard but.... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Doropyan LMAO i'm not that desperate for my star but i bet some people are using the heck out of it <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @1_618lol it's super cute ww also really funny at how it coincided with the huge undertale boom <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> so you wouldn't include it in the choice. and i'd never have come up with that as being one of the wrong choices so. WELL PLAYED. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> so much mixed feelings for that "hey ikster" line. but i can see where they came from because they got rid of suffixes completely <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @1_618lol but the jokes they had or did were fine wwww NEVER GONNA GET OVER "HEY IKSTER" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @1_618lol funnily enough i feel like the only problems amnesia's translation had may have been being a bit too literal in translations <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @gensouojou i always end up quoting nee-chama in cases like this where "your job is to keep the original work's intent" :x <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> or as i like to call it (‡∏á ‚Ä¢ÃÄ_‚Ä¢ÃÅ)‡∏á determination! //bricked <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> oh hootsuite finally changed it so i don't have favorites anymore either ww it's a heart and "like" now. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Wobbutalia i-i swear i'm not doing it on purpose! |œâ„ÉªÔºâ i can't help sounding tired when i'm tired! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ i've been mistaken for my brother over the phone before LM AO although it's hard to tell who it is from just a "hello?" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @gensouojou i have so many mixed feelings whenever i read about editors. have you seen this article? https://t.co/1MF8tpBTAl <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> awwwwkward. i think i trick people into thinking my voice is attractive when i'm really tired though cause i speak slower and it's huskier <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ignoring the one random dude at work that stopped me while i was explaining something to him just to tell me that i had a "sexy voice" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kittykatstargal LMAO same same.. i think if i had to listen to someone talk exactly like me (with the same vocal tics) i'd be annoyed <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> what would be worse. having a physical doppelganger or a voice doppelganger? www <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @himepuff surprise my brother's actually down in texas today! lmao that sounds really creepy though <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ maybe not that far but i'll be productive today at least in terms of translation-work... maybe.. 8D;; <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @gensouojou hearing that names switch from last name to first name despite character voices using the same name is a bit.. uhhHHH <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @gensouojou the sad thing about it being outsourced or when done in a translation group is when they don't reference-check with each other <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> better yet i actually got a good night's sleep without too much interruption and am now feeling like i can take on the world <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> *kicks open door* ILI IS BAAAAAAAAAACK... in action (ÔΩ•`‚ó°¬¥ÔΩ•)! my cold is pretty much gone except for the occasional cough <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> "It's your best friend!" how fast do you think I'd get up from hearing that track www "LEMME AT HIM" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I've had a transistor BGM for an alarm for so long that I'm thinking a change may be needed <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @riajuunibyou man from uncle! i was running out of characters there ww <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @tsukinohanshin @aeducan *shifty eyes* if you're thinking of a certain sawa soine CD where's he the super sweet husband then... y-yes... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> villain vol1 with the pirate is still one of those drama cDs that had me laughing at how much ~~**stamina the male lead had <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @aeducan that's... very true ww although it's rare that they finish in the mouth since guys usually just go for one run and that's the track <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @aeducan he was all like "oh gosh here let me get you a napkin to spit it ou--- YOU SWALLOWED?" lm ao (ili meet trash. trash meet ili) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @aeducan i knew you'd pick up on that wwww and hilariously i think i listened to one recently that explicitly mentioned it too-- <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @aeducan i've realized that as long as it's manaka i will swallow anything-- <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @riajuunibyou (can't remember if these were the same reviewers who hated sword's voice tho because LOL same voice actor...) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @riajuunibyou surprisingly it's more like they played transistor cause heard it was from the makers of bastion but we're disappointed we <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @riajuunibyou usually it starts off with people not wanting to play the game because the premise is that Red has her "voice taken away" :// <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @riajuunibyou nah i've heard both male and female reviewers who give transistor a bad score saying they didn't like the voice ww <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> now i wonder if it's all these jokes www does this count as queerbaiting? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> first time i saw MFU i also had an awkward theory going on that it was a female perspective hence why it doesn't have such great reviews <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> "this might be a bit bitter.. but i'll need you to swallow it solo" LOL "in and out, no mess, and we'll both forget about it in the morning" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> just watched man from uncle again with my mom this time and like lore said ww I MISSED SO MANY THINGS THE FIRST TIME <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @monochuuma me too ;w; for everyone's sake in this household. the entire family's come down with the flu already ww <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @gintsune that's a... mouthful. in more ways than o--- i'm so sorry. NOW SEE I WAS GOING TO LAUGH BUT YOU SAID THE MAGIC WORDS "manaka sawa" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @gintsune seeing those "toys" and then some employee or person asking if she wants to test them &gt; leading to the hotel LM AO <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @gintsune o-oh... OHHH. it's a tokuten. somehow i missed the tokuten and Ë≤∑„ÅÑÁâ©„Éá„Éº„Éà part so i thought the whole premise was this girl <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @gintsune waO so wild wwwww is that seriously the entire premise? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @echostruck @aeducan itsuki is his name i think? he's pretty shady from what i saw with his CGs but then again he's not sunglasses shady <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> now i'm not a doctor or anything but mother.. i don't think that's how contagious things work LM AO i won't get it just by "looking" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> my mother developed pinkeye from this cold going around and she warned me not to even look at her in the eyes because its' contagious <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> you'd think i'd learn my lesson that cold yogurt makes me cough more... but it's so delicious ;w; <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @echostruck i feel like this happened in another game that nee-chama played but my mind is drawing a blank on what game it was.. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @echostruck you can do it! (‡∏á ‚Ä¢ÃÄ_‚Ä¢ÃÅ)‡∏á chapter 3 already!! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @echostruck out so i was like "oh coincidence or?" ww the only thing i want to know is if yusa kouji's character makes it all worth it |D;; <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @echostruck ohh makes sense! i thought i was asking a dumb question haha but it sounded like you started playing it just as the english came <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @echostruck are you playing the english version or the japanese version? :o <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ i can't control the RTs on my TL!! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @himepuff I PAID MY DUES THE FIRST TIME I PLAYED IT _(:3/ i don't need no... a-achievements..... *squints eyes* <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @xBubbleTi I've seen it on both guy and girl reviews of the game ww <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @xBubbleTi I KNOW RIGHT? *breathes fire* you don't know how many times i've read that though. people who rate it lowly ALWAYS bring that up <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> take another drink whenever you read "anti-feminist bc red loses her voice" HOW DO YOU MISS THAT SHE IS THE ONE MAKING ALL THE CHOICES <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> hO W D OY OUNO TLIKE BLUE's VOICE *shakes people desperately* <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> a drink every time you read something about "neck crawling male narration" "turned off the mouthy sword" for transistor <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> https://t.co/dB7ZrBSryM who's ready to cry over transistor with me again? @riajuunibyou @ChromsSleeve <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> i fall into a coughing fit from laughing too hard. ow my ribs <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> s top. everytime i read any mention of guys tweeting about how they can't "like" other tweets now because of how "gay" it is <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> L A UGHING i had to go onto the main twitter website just to see this rainbow explosion and oh gosh it's so cute wwwwww <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @THECAROLDANVERS: #MasculinitySoFragile guys can't like a tweet with a heart on it because it threatens their sexuality https://t.co/IJW‚Ä¶ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @tsukinohanshin !! i will have to watch more then just to catch up to ep 10 ehehe <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @tsukinohanshin the contrast between their superhero and normal personalities is cute /o\ especially how marinette is like "psh no" to chat <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @tsukinohanshin i didn't even notice any mistakes www but YEAH! i'm surprised how much i like chat noir with how over the top he is <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @tsukinohanshin yep i only got around to finishing the first episode a few days ago though |D;; but its such a cute and fun show <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> i was a bit confused or what everyone was talking about because i still have my star ww https://t.co/igHWoHlIn9 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ nope just really weird things ;w; like i had where i had to jump over dogs entering a room and there were TOO. MANY. DOGS <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> thanks Sans but I can't actually grab the corners of reality and ??? transport myself??? (the problem of dreaming what you consume) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> one of them involved Sans teaching me how to "move to places without actually moving" LOL and basically it involved.. uh.. teleporting <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ugh i kept waking up at night due to coughing fits so i only got like.. 5 hours of sleep max? and i had like 10+ weird dreams/delusions <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @tsukinohanshin scrolling through all the miraculous ladybug screens you RTed and OMG YOU WATCH THIS TOO? 8DD <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @gensouojou @echostruck STARES AT THE TWO OF YOU <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> if i don't make any sense just ignore my random babbling or something during the rare moments that i'm awake <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> i just read what i wrote earlier and did any of that make sense? LMAO. just as a heads up i'm on tons of flu medication so.. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> NAP UNDER THE PIANO BEN-- ok no. not that far www but seriously i'm fed up with sleeping <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> i've turned into a cat e_e because i've been napping all over the house to avoid my room. NAPPING ON THE DINING CHAIRS. NAP ON COUCHES. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> the one thing i hate about being sick is how it makes me tired of my favorite pastime... which is sleeping. i adore sleeping and my bed <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ Œ£ Œ£ Œ£ (¬¥–¥`ÔΩåÔΩåÔΩå) i make it a rule not to google things when i'm sick because then it's like "OH GOD WHAT IF I HAVE ___" hahaha <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ I might have been too hasty saying that ww is it possible to fracture ribs from excessive coughing? cause I feel like I'm going to <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Doropyan laughing because this was my thought the entire time until i realized they had a mutual agreement |D;; <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> and you either start jamming out or weeping into your hands <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> undertale and transistor are those two games where the moment you click on an OST track you know where you are in the game <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @rabbitinwaiting i heard it's harder on steam because of steam app data and stuff but i'm sure its' still saveable! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> update 1294104: i'm still alive and on the mend now! got my voice back and just really runny nose with the occasional cough and tiredness <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @himepuff I applaud him for uh... his forward and positive thinking but... he's so so creepy crazy <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> we're talking full on maniacal glee btw and his other senses have increased and he's also like half masochistic and it was crazy #madlove <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> made him sound but tbh it doesn't get much better. he just starts laughing maniacally in ecstatic joy at how he can't see #madlove <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> AND WHY ARE YOU GUYS ALL FAVORITING THAT. I feel like I should try to spin him in a better light rather than the absolute wreck those tweets <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @riajuunibyou omg that was completely unintended <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @karakurenaii in his defence he was an artist in the Meiji era ww I don't know their views on nude models then or if he'd even study them <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @tsukinohanshin WAS NOT EXPECTING IT TO BE SO EXPLICITLY BRUTAL ON HIM <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @karakurenaii ahaha I actually really enjoyed his CD but his tokuten.... wowee <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> and there's 30secs of him rolling around screaming in pain LMAO I JUST.. WHAT DID YOU THINK WAS GONNA HAPPEN MAN #madlove <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> so he's fully committed to sculpting instead which means he doesn't need eyes (yeah ok I see where you'd think that BUT DUDE) #madlove <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> what am I listening to. WHAT JUST HAPPENED. he requests you to pour this poison into his remaining eye cause he can't paint anymore #madlove <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I just realized I never listened to that yandere!painter!sawa tokuten so I went to rectify that and... *squints eyes* W T F <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Œ£ Œ£ Œ£ (¬¥–¥`ÔΩåÔΩåÔΩå) I ONLY SLEPT FOR AN ENTIRE DAY OR SO YESTERDAY... why is wanikani punishing me with 369 reviews <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @himepuff b-but i don't feel as tired! i can actually move around and do things i just.. don't have a voice xD;; <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> i woke up and i have no voice ;;;;;; all that comes out are wheezing noises LM AO i can't tell if i'm getting better or worse <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Waganohara L A UGHING i have mixed feelings for that stupid smiling flowr <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @yui_narita not too sure! it's for halloween so probably a week or two? i've seen the date "Nov 3" around but take that with a grain of salt <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @yui_narita wasn't sure if you heard about this already or not but dragon age inquisition is on sale for $19.99 right now! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> the comments. were. intelligent???? PEOPLE WERE ACTUALLY. RATIONALLY AND CALMLY DISCUSSING THINGS. I'M. astounded. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> i read an article...... a feminism-leaning article about female character designs in video games and.... and.... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ... am i awake? or am i still sleeping? did i wake up in an alternate dimension? IS THIS THE TWILIGHT ZONE? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Wobbutalia THANK ‚ô•ÔΩû(‚Äò‚ñΩ‚Äò‰∫∫) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> now the chores around the house are on a round robin of "okay so who is feeling the LEAST shitty right now and so can cook food for us all" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> i 'm laughing it's become a domino affect. i'm sick. my dad's sick. my mom JUST got sick. my bro is still sick. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @himepuff OH LM AO... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @himepuff wait really? because i don't think i ever got a neutral ending or is it because i did a reset at the beginning? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> WHERE'S THE KAZOO VERSION THAT ALYSSA LINKED. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ except i never had any memories of doing it LMAO my dream started in the midst of my "second playthrough" w/ previous knowledge <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> took a peek at sans' BGM and OH MY GOD IT'S SO GOOD. c r I ES i want to.. try.. that fight... but............... #undertale <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> "wait a minute. I recognize this music... it's my alarm..." _(:3/ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> which fits very well as a no mercy BGM and oh my god that happened for like 10 minutes until I actually became conscious enough to realize <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> then the game restarted and... n-no mercy... and then my alarm went off and what I use for my alarm ring tone is a boss battle BGM <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> TO NO ONE'S SURPRISE I dreamt about a realistic 3D MMORPG thing and I was the hero who saved the world... the first time <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> but for now i need to pass out and pray that i don't wake up tomorrow with another fever _(:3/ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> will stalk everyone i know on tumblr for what they tagged undertale stuff with ww now that i have context woops <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @riajuunibyou @Cubsbane yep! i backtracked a ton of times ww <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @riajuunibyou keep him away from me. he's the one who was sick in the first place and caused me to get sick _(:3/ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> then the rest was just multiple multiple backtracking to explore and things <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> also took me 14 hours my first playthrough on undertale? to be fair, i might have AFKed for 1-2 hours to eat lunch/dinner <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ you know it's ridiculous and you're trying to go back to sleep but it's just like "I MUST SAVE THE WORLD" ww <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> and to do that i had to make these two choices. and even though i was trying to sleep again, another part was adamant about saving the world <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> the worst thing about being sick and maybe having a fever imo is the fever dreams. i woke up around 3am thinking i had to save the world <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @himepuff ME TOO! his extreme siscon also makes me think Kanba from MPD so i'm triply confused whenever he opens his mouth and speaks |D <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> hot and cold flashes, i can't even go across my room without breathing like i ran a marathon, and my heartbeat gets ridiculously fast <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> u GH. PERIODS ARE SO TERRIBLE. i'm pretty sure that all the shittiness i'm feeling is just amplified by the cold but not caused by it <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @yui_narita thank you ;w; you take care of yourself too with winter coming (being sick in dorms is the worst thing ever) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> What're you doing body? Hot or cold? Decide on one!! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> My mom checked up on me and I'm burning a high fever (oops) but the when I tried to nap my body temp plummeted despite 3 blankies <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I probably approach being sick the wrong way because I get some amusement trying to understand what my body is doing <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kittykatstargal haha is it a special binocular? but they probably just wrote it in katakana in the JP version and so defined it <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> TLDR I accepted and got a himedakko out of it too :') cause that's total the way to enter a peace talk (with a newly announced marriage LOL) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I can't believe my dreaming mind chose Ryouma over Marx though. YOU HAD ONE JOB BRAIN. ONE JOB. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> and offered marriage (which is what clued me in to my status but also ?? how does this create peace with Nohr??? I dunno) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> and then... as the peace talks were to commence in a stadium place everyone started filing in but Ryouma headed straight to me <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> every time I glanced over he would look back and then I'd avert my eyes in a "totally wasn't looking at you what are you talking about" way <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> and checking out Marx's ass LMAO YES SHAMELESS ME IN DREAM I would have checked Ryouma's but he's too aware of people looking at him :( <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I don't know who I was in the dream (unrelated to both sides but politically high in status???) I just remember chatting with a friend <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Nohr and Hoshido were having peace talks to settle their differences which meant Ryouma and Marx were there <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> actually talking about dreams reminds me that I had a dream previous to the torture one and it involved FE:IF stuff lmao <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ MY LAZINESS GOES ACROSS TO MY DREAMING SELF /o\ I had such a great chance too <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ I feel you ww the one and only time I realized I was dreaming I decided not to make any changes and let my subconscious do whatever <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ have you ever lucid dreamed with that when you become aware? if I ever know I'm dreaming in a dream I always wake up s o bs <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ I get annoyed whenever it pops up** <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ often enough that if whenever it pops up again ;w; <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ and no need to apologize |D that's what I live blogged them for /o/ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ he's always been one of my favorites since his first actually! I just never got around to listening to his 2nd + 3rd <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ any of them lmao especially the second series (my Japanese was so-so back then too oops) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ "like someone else" OH NO... you mean this happens again in the wasurenagusa series? ;A; at this point just assume I don't remember <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ haha oh no Mejojo is one of my favorite characters but unfortunately those words instantly associate my mind with him <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ I tend to have frequent and vivid dreams too! the ones I hate the most are teeth falling out when I don't feel stressed D: <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Wobbutalia ;A; I'm afraid of dream analysis and what this might mean about my inner psyche wwww <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> And they screamed so loud and long that I woke up /o\ BRAIN WHAT ARE YOU DOING <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> All you need to know about me is that I dreamed someone was being tortured to reveal where I was hiding <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> "He has two eyes!! He's no longer covering one with a cloth!! He looks really sexy like this now and my tension went up" L O L #wasurepain <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Listening to the free talk so I can hopefully not sleep on a tear-stained pillow and LMAO naonii asks if you notice the cover #wasurepain <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Words that are forever ruined for me due to BWS "‰ø∫„ÅÆ‚Ä¶‰ø∫„Å†„Åë„ÅÆ„ÇÇ„ÅÆ" and "„ÇÑ„Å£„Å®Êâã„Å´ÂÖ•„Çå„Åü" thanks Mejojo <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Throaty watery sound check. Wheezing check. Abnormal hitches and constant voice shakes check. IT'S DISTURBINGLY REAL #wasurepain <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I AM SO CONCERNED Naonii's wounded voice is really alarming because it sounds like he's actually breathing through bloody lungs #wasurepain <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The hand fixation is prob why I love Saitou's tracks so much ;w; "tell me again that you don't mind my blood-stained hands" #wasurepain <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> THROW ME OFF A CLIFF. they invoked the ultimate sad last night BGM and h i s speech. He keeps apologizing and asking permission #wasurepain <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Fortunately his asshole move is short and he breaks when you touch his cheek and still don't hate him. NICE "‰ø∫„ÅØ‚Ä¶‰ø∫„ÅØ‚Ä¶„ÅÑ„ÇÑ„Å†" #wasurepain <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> And now 180 AGAIN oh man naonii's tortured voice. He's trying SO HARD to be a villain and his voice is shaking ;A; #wasurepain <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> You refuse. And he flips out "then let me show you the powerlessness of a woman" ??? commence dubcon?? SIDE-EYEING YOU SAITOU #wasurepain <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> He was pleading "There is only death for me at the end of this road. You must live. Please... I don't want to make you cry" #wasurepain <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I WHIPLASHED FROM 8DD cry more saitou to :((( yo this is an asshole move #wasurepain <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @aeducan it's Saitou's second one kekkonroku! I really must have slept through it all because I don't remember any of this lmao <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ Niiight /o/ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ although then again the rest of the tracks are 5 min long (I should finish and prepare for the 3rd ww) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ aha I'll be sure to keep tagging them! I'll probably sleep after this long track too since it's 3am here though /o\ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> And then you remind him of the mutual confession on the boat and he breaks down it's amazing #wasurepain <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> "You think you mean anything just because I slept with you? Hah! There are countless replacements" B R U TAL MAN #wasurepain <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> "You want to stay with that pitiful skill? Pathetic." "If you truly want to stay then show me your resolve and cut me." #wasurepain <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Gods it hurts how hard he's trying to push you away ;w; "You think you can disobey me? Know your place, woman." #wasurepain <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ he's ordering her away but she rips up his paper orders and wants to stay so then you two spar with him beating you www <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ SAME! Or like "half sugar please" on any mixed drinks or coffee etc <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ??? Did I pass out the first time I listened to Saitou's kekkonroku because I don't remember this scene at all and it's epic #wasurepain <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ I think I'm right before something interesting so it's a bit like "oops teehee I just needed to gaman" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ I definitely had much more tolerance when I was younger too! Now I start feeling physically sick after like 2 bites <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ it's the blogging that slows me down |D because common scenes feel extraaa long and I just want to get into the pain <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ after psychedelica I'll return back to Hime-hen 8D;; I was burning out for some reason in the common route Day 11ish <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ my feeling for psychedelica is like BWS in that I really enjoyed it but I think if it's not people's thing then they won't like it <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ to the point where even if you don't like the story or premise you have to admit they did a damn good story <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ I haven't fully completed it yet so I'll have to get back to you on that but hmm it's like HA's writing is imo phenomenal <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @rizweld shame ww beniyuricchi? kagicchi? tansaiboucchi--- //bricked <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @rizweld okay that's true ww doesn't he give people nicknames too? i swear i heard "hikagecchi" somewhere <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @rizweld DOESN'T HE REMIND YOU OF KISE? he has the yellow theme. he has stupid star and heart and music note endings w w w <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ i really like wanikani but it only teaches you kanji. you won't learn any grammar from it! (there's also a subscription) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> but even eating that made me feel a bit sick _(:3/ i have such an incredibly low tolerance for sweets it's ridiculous <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> whenever i'm in an ambivalent snacking mood i go for a one-bite chocolate bar. it's tiny. like bite-sized tiny. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I love salty things too much and I don't know why I keep forgetting that <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ i feel like it's theme may be a hit and miss with some people <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ Hmm, I'd rate HA 5/5 definitely but I think Psychedelica is a 4/5 ;;; like it's not a bad story but not a MUST RECOMMEND haha <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> when i tried to explain that i remember Êåë„ÇÄ because idomu = indominus rex = challenge to my bro he gave me a strange look :( <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> "hey isn't that eye-- no wait.. that's a unibrow above a drooling mouth. aka. NOT eyebrow... so shoulder!!" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> i'm going to remember shoulder from such a roundabout way now that i'm discussing it so much LMAO i'll be like <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @shinkaiism @gensouojou in defense of unibrows everywhere, unibrows are still brows!! „Éæ( &gt;Ôπè&lt;„ÄÇ)Ôæâ„Çõbut unibrow+drooling mouth is...... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @gensouojou @shinkaiism YEAH. totally makes sense that you'd need uh... two eyebrows... LMAO my own mnemonics fail me :'( <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @shinkaiism ooh yeah! i think in the past i get tripped up because Êà∏ looks like an eyebrow above an eye... box www <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> it's not. i'm a bad student :'( wanikani will teach me the difference one day or maybe i'll finally recognize that there's no Êà∏ in eyebrow <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> BUT TODAY IS NOT THAT DAY. whatever, whether they're furrowing their eyebrows or slumping their shoulders IT'S THE SAME THI--- //bricked <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> one day i will be able to tell "shoulder" from "eyebrow" apart in japanese. ONE DAY. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @rizweld @gensouojou not sure! next time i get in battle i'll let you know! (i grinded way too many points for my S achievement |D) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @rizweld @gensouojou oh no now you're making me curious to hear if they'll say scathing things if we get an F www <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> in my case it's someone staring at his hand after taking beniyuri's hand and T_____T #‰∫åÈÄ£ÈªíÂ≠êÈëëË≥û <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> psychedelica is like HA when you're like "oh iroha hospital scene" but then final playthrough "OH HAHA. IROHA HOSPITAL SCENE T____T" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> nee-chama's playing reminds me to kick my own butt into gear and going through these previous scenes while knowing everything.. ;w; #‰∫åÈÄ£ÈªíÂ≠êÈëëË≥û <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @rizweld they're so mean when i'm pretty sure it's literally impossible to get higher than that on your first round ;w; <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @daisypeony @aeducan oh wow your relationships with everyone is so high ww <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @shinkaiism oh okay! have fun 8D <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @gensouojou pssst the single for "i am girl" is out and the tracks are so good *A* <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Cubsbane the "..." is so rude &gt;:'( i'm just being a proper explorer <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @miraofazuresky i'm wondering if Ë£∏ is more like a state of being while ÂÖ®Ë£∏ implies like.. there are options but you need to ___ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> gotta flip over every chair and table and vase to collect things wwww <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> if someone tells you to go to the right you betcha i'm gonna go to the left. pick up the phone? NOT UNTIL I EXPLORE THE HOUSE <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> i won't post any more after this but LOL HEY! the one and only rule of RPGs is never do what anyone says #undertale https://t.co/3ngUaJxMDT <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> i don't get it. what's the difference between ÂÖ®Ë£∏ and Ë£∏? www <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> woah chill there. sheesh if you want me to pay you okay. it's just expedient bc you're already going grocery shopping and i'm not <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> then when i found out my mom was going grocery shopping i was like "hey can you buy some juice?" SHE SNAPPED LMAO "GO OUT AND GET YOUR OWN" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> but my bro is really sick right now so i guess my mom is under stress? got in a yelling fight with my bro about his health <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> people in my family love lashing out when irritated (myself included but i'm very conscious of it and so always take care not to) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> and people wonder why i'm so quiet or have developed such a great ability to read faces and the mood <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ i'm kidding there's probably gonna be sad soliloquies for 15 minutes or something ;w; <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ ngl i'm a bit alarmed. 40 minutes means there's definitely going to be a r18 scene but F O R T Y MINUTES... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ON A SCALE OF STEVEN UNIVERSE TO DRAMATICAL MURDER w w w w w <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> we've reached the pinnacle of cross fandoms i'm cr YING https://t.co/Yz0bJBeCcv <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> WHAT. WHY IS THIS ONE TRACK 40 minutes long omg <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> (I keep on falling asleep still at night so I gave up and am listening to it in the morning) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> "a fitting place for me to die" ;www; I take back what I said about Saitou's kekkonroku track it's sad #wasurepain <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ same same ww it's very hit and miss with me which is why he's not one of my biases |D <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> heard that verbal tic in real life* cause I'd probably swoon and fall in love with whoever does that lmao <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @aeducan *w* no... but you know me I can't ever resist voice drops wwww (will look this up!) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It's magic I say ww it's like seeing someone genuinely smile except it's a complete verbal tic and IM HONESTLY GLAD I HAVEN'T HEARD IT IN RL <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> it creates this smooth sounding effect but when he's teasing he emphasizes and pauses on hard syllables and it never fails to make me grin <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> HE HAS SOME OF THE CUTEST INFLECTIONS THOUGH S C R EAMS like he mumbles or slurs his words casually while still sounding clear <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm okay with his normal voices but they're not as memorable to me for some reason /o\ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> couldn't sleep so I listened to okitsu's black panther and... I just remembered why he's a top tier r18 seiyuu too w w w w <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @aeducan @Doropyan @jilatlanun @yukiruyume is it just going to be a retelling I wonder with extra scenes or? :o <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> never forget how low and rumbly kishio's voice can get when singing this song _(:3/ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ random but I was suddenly reminded since we were talking about Ikki earlier. have you heard this? https://t.co/JbXFYA8lcC <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @aeducan the bleeding out friend one? /o\ i've never gotten enough points for some reason <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @aeducan it hurt my heart when i was bloodthirsty and went "use the knowledge to get us the best deal obvs" and he gives a sad smile :( <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @aeducan do you get to talk to him when he's lighting a cigarette in scorpion land? because i can never seem to ;;; <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @aeducan omg HOW DO YOU NOT HAVE THE POETRY ACHIEVEMENTS WITH HIM wwww i can only ever get him to 55 painfully <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @aeducan yeah i feel that too! i tried a "revolution/rebellion" end and even then it was like cliffhanger-ish end with me taking down pipes <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @aeducan i think what cracked me up was the surprise knife when i was on a vacation with the Red King... THAT WAS WEIRD <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @aeducan no i think that's pretty much how it is ww you go on vacation alone after whatever and then KNIFE www <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @aeducan DID YOU LEARN ABOUT HIS PAST BTW? (sleeping with him during the murder case and he reveals his patchworks) ;wwwwww; <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @aeducan ;w; me too. the endings can be a little lacklustered though. I want a agony run somehow by sleeping with jess then the last fight <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @aeducan I don't have the candle one either /o\ just uh the nightmare one and bathtub one so far! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @aeducan it's jess ;;; doc committed suicide with his help to be a martyr cause he was being blackmailed by Bueakhjgfh-what'shisname <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @aeducan do you want me to spoil who it is for the bath one? /o\ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @aeducan *whispers* investigate jess' room and bahauahmjgfh <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> note to self: don't gamble with your life when you have low crafting and are against a craft-slaying weapon #ThirstyDeathless <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @aeducan i feel cheated by letting myself die while on a vacation with the Red King LMAO YOU'D THINK HE'D BE ABLE TO REPAIR MY SOUL LAME <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I DIDNT GET TO CHAT WITH HIM IN SCORPION LAND BUT I DID IT #ThirstyDeathless https://t.co/kNuevsEB3A <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> except for saving the village and screwing Ots over because screw that guy man #ThirstyDeathless <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> alright that's it. one last try. i'm just gonna be super gung-ho about the city and power and wealth and sleep with jones #ThirstyDeathless <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I should just purposefully antagonize everyone so only Red King has the highest points <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> STARES JEALOUSLY AT MITSU AND ALL HER KOPIL SCENES while i stumble around in circles with Jess and Verity <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @aeducan ww power of sheer craft carried me through. i'm surprised at 87% craft i couldn't break the nightmare myself though o_o <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Goddamnit Kopil www THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE. I'm either too bloodthirsty or not interesting enough to tip him over 55% #ThirstyDeathless <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm a shambling corpse. I don't know how I feel about that lmao #ThirstyDeathless https://t.co/KKNXetQQzb <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @aeducan THAT JUST HAPPENED TO ME W W W did your game just end there? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> WHY WON'T YOU LOVE ME lmao #ThirstyDeathless this guy is gonna pay for killing me when my Craft is so high https://t.co/zS2wfr0ScH <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @himepuff meanwhile i guess cause dads don't have that "maternal(or paternal) caring instinct" they're allowed to live as antags or clueless <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @himepuff they wouldn't let the protags get up to what they do (or let things happen to protags) so that's why they're usually off-ed :( <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @himepuff i read an interesting article about this (can't remember where now) but because moms are seen as more parental/attentive/caring <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> this is one is great. CONFLICT.

<Text_Begin> my dad was outside smoking when the people came back for a second round too and was thrown to the ground :/ small surface head wound <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> so I always think if she had decided to workout that day she could have gotten hit by the rock + glass shards <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> which sucks and all that but my mother had the habit of doing her workout there at night, only that night she didn't do it or was late <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> happened way back in the past (and a previous house) but it resulted in my living room's full pane window being shattered by a rock <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ugh *scrubs face* the dream brought back awful memories too. Did I ever tell you guys about the time my house was vandalized? <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> there weren't any extraneous things added for ~~**spoopy effect and yeah the imagery that it could work with bc of the setting elements A++ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ugh still thinking about it and i felt like i learned something in terms of setting up atmosphere and writing. IT WAS SO GOOD <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> there wasn't anything groundbreaking in terms of story elements but it had such solid writing (i kinda want more gothic romances now) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> back from watching Crimson Peak and i loved it „Éæ(:3ÔæâÔΩº„Éæ)ÔæâÔΩº it wasn't terrifying (thankfully) but so atmospherically chilling @xBubbleTi <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @senaoi_ hmm i think ymmv i thought the first one was boring and nearly dropped the series but the 2nd one is too cute <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> he pauses for like 10 seconds of just him breathing and staring back w w w w THESE TWO. THIS GUY MOSTLY. c u t e o v e r l o a d <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> the heroine was staring at him and he's like "this is kinda embarrassing" and then as revenge mid-way through a "scene" <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> on another note man online competitive games are so toxic and i can never play those games for too long because... why u gotta be so rude :( <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> i guess it's kind of compliment to be accused of hacking/cheating in game because apparently i was good at finding people ??? <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> so when i see things like "hadaka shitsuji" I JUST. I DUNNO I READ IT BUT IT DOESN'T OCCUR TO ME. katamari damacy... *throws hands up* <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> like "Witcher"? just means the in game thing. "Metal Gear Solid"? ËèØ„Ç¢„ÉØ„Çª? they don't really mean much when placed together <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> my first instinct re titles is to think of them as having some ingame meaning or a combination of pretty words <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Cubsbane so far i think okami was the only game where the title instantly registered to me as being a pun/actual meaning <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @aeducan „Éæ(:3ÔæâÔΩº„Éæ)ÔæâÔΩº why don't i ever think japanese titled games MEAN something literal *coughs* hadaka shitsuji <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @echostruck do you want to burst out crying whenever you call for your kitty? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @echostruck c-cappucino... that's adorable. TAPIOCA. (wait why are they all food names) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @echostruck ahHHHHHH THOSE EYES ARE GORGEOUS ;A; that means you'd have to change the name you came up with for the black cat tho right? ww <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> they're basically like "outside is dangerous so don't run around randomly/wildly" bUT THEIR EXPRESSIONS AT THE EN D. they know <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> also LOL from this one that i can kind of make out. the girl is like "wai wai" and her parents call her back http://t.co/IBiaIugnI4 <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @gensouojou have they shown the game art already? :o i assumed it'd be the same as the manga's too (which is close to the anime) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @gensouojou @ChromsSleeve LORE AND MITSU NEVER LET ME LIVE DOWN THE FACT THAT I GOOGLED "hadaka shitsuji" cause i didn't know what it was <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> except it's also particularly frustrating for game players because it's like "nooOOOOO HOW COULD YOU MISS THAT SCENE" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> except wait nevermind. that's basically what animes AFTER games do anyway LMAO they only barely touch the surface of the charass <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> and it's great cuz once the game comes out you get to explore their charas in more detail! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> i can see where they might take the game, what with the guys introducing themselves and like "come to ME for help" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> on a more serious note and back to DwD i feel like THIS is how they should market a game rather than game &gt; anime <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> a moment of silence for when nee-chama talked about oirans "servicing" customers and i thought she meant pouring tea or smthing <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @gensouojou @ChromsSleeve i was so innocent at the beginning :'( <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @gensouojou wait i was assuming the tattsun was the dog... transforming.. but is he another chara altogether!? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @gensouojou i'm gonna laugh if tattsun also provided the dog noises (but it's prolly just generic dog sounds) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @goldensneer W H Y. a combination of two things that hurt me very much. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> IT WAS A SALAD RIGHt? EGG SALAD? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> N. O. onii-chans are forbidden from being anywhere close to salad ever since uh... kin.. no.. something?? http://t.co/9k2uDH7FUt <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kittykatstargal ;w; no idea. i still need a chart when i'm watching MPD just to keep track of what's going on lmao <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @gensouojou i think i read bits and pieces of it when i was trying to read analyses on MPD but i don't remember anything anymore <Text_End>

"who cares if you get thrown away? you can kiss a hundred times over"
s C REAMS gO AWAY DEVIL <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> "kisses alone aren't enough?"
