<Text_Begin> @liacausaren wala namang lakad Maha. Bahay lang. Nag aya si Baka kanina kila Ron daw? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> My plan to stay in &amp; work on my fanfiction will probably be a fail. Just got invited to a chillage later. I don't think I wanna go though. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Watched Toy Story 3. I was in tears when Andy gave his toys away. #nerdalert <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Where are you guys, @korinamarteja ? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Staying in tonight. Woot woot! Hoping to write at least 3 chapters for my novel slash fanfiction. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> That was the first time in so long that I ate like a monster. Ordered 9 rolls of sushi, 4 pieces of shrimp tempura &amp; agedashi tofu. PIG! :@) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Unlimited sushi tonight! Nom nom nom! :3 (@ Sura) http://t.co/DIk2jDoL <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Elena's first kill is so, so satisfying okay? Elena killing Connor is the best moment in this season so far. #tvd AND KATHERINE IS BACK! <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Pity those who needs other people's approval to feel secure about themselves. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Your talent on pissing the living daylights out of me is promising. Starting to think the Devil brought you to earth on a mission to do so. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> My shin still hurts from yesterday's "accident." I hate my body for being so uncoordinated. -__- <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Read Reflected In You by Sylvia Day in a span of 5 hours. Liked it. Not as much as I liked Christian Grey's story, though. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> "Sometimes love isn't enough. And if it's not enough, what good is it?" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Finally created a #Dramione / #HarryPotter dedicated blog. Follow please, fellow pottergeeks &amp; Dramione shippers? http://t.co/ItEUHwPG <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I may occasionally have concerns, and you'll be sensible about acknowledging them. 'Sensible' being whatever I've decided is best. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> We'll tear each other apart until there's nothing left. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @thedayofthedot: my feelings don't matter, so neither should yours. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Woke up late. Ran up the stairs. Missed a step. Currently lying in bed with a pack of frozen fries patched on my right leg. Bravo! <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @iansomerhalder for president! (Although I'm not from America......) LOL! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I wouldn't have dared to call this thing between us anything like a friendship. More like a mutual tolerance, with occasional conversation. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> All that followed as she walked were rumors, nothing was known beyond the fundamentals. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Absolutely dislike reading unfinished fics but I ran out of options. Seems like I already read all the good ones. This is frustrating. :/ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> There is always some madness in love. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Makes me want to cry when authors don't finish their work. Especially when it's a really, really great piece! #Dramione <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ..12th chapter. Still have 32 to go. I love long fics so this shouldn't take me long to finish. #Dramione #Pottergeek #Potterhead <Text_End>
