<Text_Begin> @kingimpp @philippenis alright well you keep living with a Bible stuck up your ass while I get more pussy than you ever will. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> it disgusts me when people use their religion to hide their homophobic beliefs. no religion teaches people to be hateful, you chose to be. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kingimpp @philippenis according to you, Jesus is a sinner since he ate fish and the Bible says LITERALLY not to eat seafood. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kingimpp @philippenis your only arguement is that God wrote the Bible and that's not even relevant....his prophets did LMAOO. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kingimpp @philippenis you're the one who's wrongly interpreting it. give up, you look ridiculous and uneducated. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kingimpp @philippenis ..so you just called Jesus a sinner..lmao. go read all of the Bible before you decide to take excerpts literally. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @kingimpp @philippenis god also said your ugly and your mom doesn't love you. see how easy it is to interpret the Bible? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kingimpp @philippenis also, the "abomination of homosexuality" is not universal in all religions. &amp; your religion is not above others lol. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kingimpp @philippenis are you truly that ignorant and obsessed with homosexuality? or just very simple minded. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kingimpp @philippenis why are u placing ur obsession with the homosexuality "teachings" above the most important teaching of Christianity? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kingimpp @philippenis if you want to talk literal, God said that above all we must love one another no matter the circumstance. (c) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kingimpp @philippenis technically ur calling God homophobic considering ur saying it's His literal word &amp; i'm saying its interpretation lol <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kingimpp @philippenis i'm sure you have Muslim family members from every single Islamic sect lmao gtg. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kingimpp @philippenis homosexuality doesn't need your approval or disapproval, it's there no matter what you think your "God" said. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kingimpp @philippenis you're attempt at using your christian beliefs to describe what the islamic religion teaches is also ignorant/false. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kingimpp @philippenis you're the one upset over the fact that your ignorant homophobia off of biblical interpretations is blatantly wrong. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kingimpp @philippenis God said it's an abomination to eat meat/seafood, wear 2 different materials of clothing, etc. You believe that too? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kingimpp @philippenis God didn't write the Bible, his word was interpreted and therefore the Bible leaves room for further interpretation. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kingimpp @philippenis the Bible is to be interpreted..not taking literally. your interpretation of the Bible is not universal lmao. <Text_End>
