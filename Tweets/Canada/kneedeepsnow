<Text_Begin> @kneedeepsnow every team starts at different points of the course, and the objective is to go as far as you can in the double block and <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kneedeepsnow basically everyone was in groups of five or six, and everyone had a water bottle full of water that they couldn't spill <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kneedeepsnow uneven bars, those rings that hang from the celing, the Rope, the gigantic mat, the massive rolling platform for the giant mat <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> and by all the gym equipment I mean ALL the gym equipment. we used benches and balance beams, and the beat board and volleyball net holders <Text_End>
