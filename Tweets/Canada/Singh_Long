<Text_Begin> So Akuma's in Tekken 7? Guess that explains why he's not in SFV. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @PixelMatt64 Nah, I know my laptop's not up for this. Besides, this was a FreeC test. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Xrd did not pass the potato test. *sighs* <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> So it looks like Lighting Returns on Steam is a corrupted wish. Better framerates/pacer at the cost of resolutions above 1080. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> That Re;Birth 3 crash I talked about earlier? Got past it by patching the exe to use more than 2GB RAM. A really odd oversight on IFI's part <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Finally got EXE Drives and EX Finishers. They still work the same way, thought they're tied to SP now instead of a separate gauge. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Before I forget, another change in Re;Birth 3 is that you can still do pair switches even if all of the active party is KO'd. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Apparently Plutia's HDD transformation is so kick ass, the game crashed before I had a chance to see what it looked like :P <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ilikefunny505 Lily Ranks aren't a huge deal in R1 since solo EXE drives are more than enough. R2...let's just say they're REALLY important. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ilikefunny505 I'm still early in the game, so I have no idea how EXE drives and attacks will work now. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Singh_Long Also, this entry actually has a couple of in-game rendered cutscenes so far. Dunno if more will pop up. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> So Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth3 changed up how SP works. You can build it up with attacks just like the EXE gauge from the previous two <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Dammit Steam, I know what you're trying to pull. You will not tempt me away from Nep Nep! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Just did a "stress" test with Tales of Zestiria. The game works fine with my potato laptop. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mark142011 @MoogleSenpai @Margolis64 Type-0 doesn't have full HD textures and has a 30 FPS frame lock. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mark142011 @MoogleSenpai @Margolis64 It really depends on the game. XIII and XIII-2 work fine until it slips up its frame rate. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mark142011 @Margolis64 Yeah. A worse example was Need For: Speed Rivals, since that game was made alongside the console versions. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mark142011 @Margolis64 It's tricky dealing with PC ports from consoles that were hardcoded for 30FPS. Sometimes, unlocking FPS breaks stuff <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 @mark142011 You know you've got a solid port with a 92% Steam rating and Durante's Seal of Approval. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 IIRC, not every game can handle GFX adjustments during gameplay. I can name a couple of examples I own off the top of my head. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Hi <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai You should've covered by saying it was how we do things in Canada, <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 I....really don't see how it's P2W if it's a non-competitive game and the stuff is purely optional. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 IIRC that's just early unlocks for stuff you get for free on NG+. It's nothing new to Tales games. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 I heard it's solid outside of a couple of strict QTEs in 60FPS mode and some minor textures not being updated. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> This legitimately sounds reassuring in regards to Zestiria:
https://t.co/LNYXqyOYpC <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 On a technical level, it's fine. Just have to adjust to the different campaigns. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 @MoogleSenpai I just don't if redeeming a DLC code without owning the game will work. I know you can't buy DLC with a full game. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Now the "fun" begins... http://t.co/59Wjin1Mqn <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kamatsubu It's fine. I just had to let it reinstall GFWL and it worked fine. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Singh_Long ...to Steam. Why? Capcom got the transfer right with Ultra Street Fighter IV. Why not RE5? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> OK, so I was somewhat wrong. I DO have to have GFWL installed, despite the game no longer using it, because it's needed to import saves... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kamatsubu It does. Even more so when all you got to work with is a potato laptop. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I can run RE5 just fine at 60FPS, though I'll lower it to 30 since it made my fan spin a bit more. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> What's weird is that Steam insists on showing me a product code for RE5 to enter, yet I didn't have to use it either. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Hopefully if I verify cache, I can try again without GFWL this time. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> So I didn't have to install GFWL when installing RE5, but removing it after the fact prevents me from running it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DjChiszle I thought crouch jumping was a "bug"? :P <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 Yee <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I completely forgot Deus Ex: Revision was a thing. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 Between this, Citra, Xenia, and RPCS3, it looks like the emulation scene is getting a burst. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GhoulWorldOrder If you can, go to the video options of ePSXe. It should say which plugin is used. You might be using an OGL instead of DX. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GhoulWorldOrder What are you using for the video plugin? <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai If the live streams are any indication, it's shaping up to be a solid port. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Happy Canadian Thanksgiving or Columbus Day for Americans. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 That happens with a lot off these bundles/incentives. It sucks. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm sorry, but whoever came up with the ending requirements for HNR2 needs to die in a fire. Holy fuck, grinding for shares is so unfun. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @kamatsubu They're pretty much the reason why I never bothered to do Full Synchro reruns. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> http://t.co/WYKpNtPl2r

As long as I'm not forced to use the Windows Sto-oh who the fuck am I kidding? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kamatsubu That and they tend to shove female allies under the bus a lot. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kamatsubu Well KR just started using hoods hehehe. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Singh_Long I guess the devs realized this when porting Fairy Fencer F, which explains why that game ran fine for me out of the gate. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Singh_Long changes screen size and not how graphics are rendered. Thanks to an unofficial fix, the games run FAR smoother than before. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> So all this time, the Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth1 and 2 Steam ports had the same issue as REHD, where adjusting resolution only... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kamatsubu Really strange. I guess the devs never accounted for that at the time. If I still had the 360 version, I'd try to replicate it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kamatsubu What version are you playing it on? Because I never had that happen to me when I played the 360 version. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Just played the original Tomb Raider and holy fuck, the controls have aged poorly. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @BrianWord1 @MainEventTV_AKA Upon closer inspection, it looks like it was just a troll. Hopefully. http://t.co/ApCqp8mL9z <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MainEventTV_AKA Don't know if this was legit, but...well: http://t.co/h4j8AvVEs1 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ...going to voice the MC from FC3, but was replaced because Ubisoft thought people would associated him with just Adam Jensen IIRC. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> So apparently the new Far Cry MC is being voiced by the same guy who did Adam Jensen. Kinda funny, considering how he was actually... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> So just for kicks, I did Chris' campaign on Very Easy. Only times I died were due to fucking Lisa knocking into the pit. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> So they upped the minimum requirements for Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth 3 and it uses DirectX10. Hope I can still run it on this potato. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 They fucked up the minimum graphics, LOL. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MorgueZombie @MainEventTV_AKA @RockawayCarter Oh god... http://t.co/FZjtsCTWCZ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Could've used those flame rounds for zombies, but I hadn't saved in a while and I didn't want to restart that whole stretch. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> So I fucked up the Black Tiger boss fight by wasting 3-4 flame rounds on the door trying to bypass it. Forgot they give you another knife. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Despite a major fuck up where I lost two max herbs due to two zombies, so far I think I'm doing ok after beating the elder Crimson Head. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Welp, out of kerosene. Looks like I have to be careful with the shotgun unless I want to deal with Crimson Heads. Only found 2 death masks. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Welp, can't do 60 FPS, but going from 10 to 30 is still a good thing. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Holy shit. This unofficial FPS fix for REHD actually makes it playable on my potato at 30 FPS. Should check if it'll still hold up at 60 FPS <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @OperativeRen Once, I woke up because my cousin's cat kept licking my face. Not how I wanted pussy... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> BUY THIS GAME: http://t.co/S8Kot4v0rj <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @HungarianWOrder Yup. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kamatsubu Fun fact: The Assassin you play as in the sequel IS voiced by Sonic. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Should be useful for make some games a bit more playable on this potato laptop. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> So there's a program called SWITCH that lowers some GFX details on games in order to increase FPS. Only tried one game, but there's results. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Been over a day and a half since I filed that refund request, and Steam hasn't responded yet. Doesn't usually take this long... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 Assuming she makes it. I don't trust any coincidental "leaks". <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 Not surprised. Zangief's a staple, and R. Mika was in. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Azure Striker Gunvolt finally has keyboard rebind. A bit odd on how it's implemented, but it works. Skills are still stuck on F1-4 though... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Upon closer inspection, they're all upgrades from single player. If they're early unlock codes, then it's no big deal. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Wound up getting the Tomb Raider bundle, but it turns out 5 DLCs from the reboot weren't included. Huh? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @OperativeRen All because they wanted to wait for one guy to help with programming and he wasn't available? Nahnsense... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mark142011 Damn. Filled with envy right now, lol. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 If anything, it just seems more like lazy coding and incompetence rather than an engine. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 Uhhh,,,https://t.co/QuBgnwnhbK <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 The fuck? Did the exact same thing with me. Exactly. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 Just double checked. ToO and its DLC aren't in the bundle at all. Or were you referring to its quality? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 Temple of Osiris isn't in the bundled. Apparently, it's buggy and imbalanced for solo. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 I'm debating it. It's a steal, I know that, but I don't know if I really want it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Not touch Battle Fantasia either. Had bad memories of it when I still had the 360 version. No way am I willing going to relive that on PC. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'd get Arcana Heart instead, but for some reason, that's double the price. Sorry, but I'm not paying that much. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I completely forgot GGXX#R also had that in Story mode as well. I'll rebuy the game on a bigger sale once I get a new rig with a controller. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> So due to me only having a keyboard that can't handle IK's, I'll have to refund GGXXAC+R for now. The game ran beautifully otherwise. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Finally, that discount on GGXXACR dropped. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Come watch the salt: http://t.co/kcuEiXz2Ib <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I like how that Tomb Raider bundle on Steam leaves out Temple of Osiris, since I hear that game had serious unresolved problems. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> So by most reports, SW4-II is a solid port aside from the usual NPC texture business. They even got online stuff working. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Looks like Samurai Warriors 4-II on PC is another hybrid port. Not surprised. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Dunno if I want this many boobs: http://t.co/4SPPXMQ7iV <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Welp, having looked at Mighty Gunvolt's manual, turns out rebinding keys aren't necessary. They actually have more than one setup active <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Esc immediately quits the game without warning, and supposedly some AMD users can't see enemies. Hopefully Inti is quick to patch this. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Mighty Gunvolt is out. Game runs absolutely fine, but I'm stuck with Fullscreen mode with no video settings and no keyboard rebinds. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @CyberIceBlood Still need to play my copy of it. Tricky battle system. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Finally finished Fairy Fencer F. A bit on the easy side, depending on how your approach it, but a fun game nonetheless. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @SevenInContext @DSP_txt Seems like it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ....OK, I'll admit I hadn't expected those twists in Fairy Fencer F just now. Too bad I didn't pick up that last fury back at the Desert. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai OMG....fucking Galdo lol <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @DoctorOfFizz Aww, you graduated from One Direction to Randi Harper. You have my condolences. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> So Steam version of FFV has mixed reviews, and has a bunch of graphical bugs on certain machines. Not surprised. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai :) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai True. Some people just can't take the time to read the fine print lol. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai Symphonia's gonna come to PC regardless. That pre-order thing just means they'll get it for free. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> So I'm just starting to piece together what happened with the Prison School dub

<Text_Begin> RT @MainEventTV_AKA: So they're celebrating their unprofessionalism in changing dialog, way to be adult! Fucking pathetic, get fired! http:… <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 Right now, it appears to be a Korean only release that's confirmed, but H2 has brought their other ports outside of it before. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Dammit. Had to fix that last tweet because I forgot the link. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Not an explicit confirmation, but it looks like BlazBlue: Chrono Phantasma Extend might be coming to Steam. http://t.co/aqZxLHtn9o <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 @MoogleSenpai DO IT! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai I see. I just hope I trigger the worst ending first, because that's how I usually do things. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai Really? That's interesting. Do I get the worst ending if I unseal the Vile God? That's what I'm trying to do right now. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I think I'm starting to see why Fairy Fencer F is said to be pretty easy. It gives you free stat boosts for doing certain actions often. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Can't wait for @L33tDrops to launch! I'm going to be #gaming for free! http://t.co/t7uA1IsFNF <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> OMG this song: https://t.co/DYvsRvAV4Y

I love this game. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Singh_Long ...And the game is getting an expansion on PS4...I pray it will be DLC for PC owners, unlikely as that is. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Wait a min...Fairy Fencer F was written by Toshiki Inoue? This should be interesting. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 Congrats dude! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 If it is, that's a bit short even for a Mega Man game, and those could be easily done in a session. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 The fuck? The game isn't even out for a few more months. How was the length determined? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Should look up Youtube song playlists more often. Dunno why, but Deluxe sounds catchy. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @OperativeRen Nine salty aliens and John Cena I bet. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 @drgnkiller It's not old, so they could easily get it fixed/replace for free, right? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DSP_txt JRPGs on PC have only been a thing recently. They just discovered a potential market. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DSP_txt For PC?. None yet, but Zestiria is out in a month. Symphony will come at a later date. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @OperativeRen @GhoulWorldOrder @OrangeLight7895 Guess it'd be closer to the OnoKast then? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mark142011 While Fairy Fencer F was the PS3 example, and that game runs super smooth on anything. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mark142011 I was citing Hyperdimension Neptunia R1 and 2 as the Vita ports. They are great ports, but my weak laptop treats them like GIFs. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Strange how a PC port of a PS3 game is more optimized for potatoes than two Vita-to-PC ports made by the same company. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Picked up the Dead Island Collection, but I'll hold off on playing it till I get a new rig. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kamatsubu We're still in the era of overestimating console power and bad coding practices. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kamatsubu Can't be worse than Deus Ex HR: Director's Cut on the 360. Shit loading times and even then, it takes an extra 3 sec for textures <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ilikefunny505 I didn't make the cut either. Hopefully it'll be 50% on launch like FFF was. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ilikefunny505 I'm sure it'll be on sale again. The third should be out soon. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @ilikefunny505: @Singh_Long "I'm a huge fan of female characters and a cute story, dewd." XD <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ilikefunny505 Can't have too much of a good thing. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Of course if Fairy Fencer F has alternate endings as well...same thing. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Gonna save the alternate endings of HNR2 for another run in a new rig. Now it's time for Fairy Fencer F. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kamatsubu @DoctorOfFizz @drgnkiller Gotham High did leave us with Batman Beyond though. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kamatsubu IIRC, Burial At Sea is said to be the only real Story DLC. The rest are like Protector Trials. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 Odd how this happened just as there's a huge WB sale going on right now. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @MorgueZombie ...Isn't that just asking for trouble with kids? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 @MoogleSenpai If it's just the texture thing, it's no huge deal. Based on what people say about OPW3, not many  complained <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 @MoogleSenpai Eventually, I hope to pick up that and SW4-II. It's been a while since I bought a new DW game. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 @MoogleSenpai Bladestorm Nightmares can be added to that as well. That didn't even fix the issues the PS4 version had. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 @MoogleSenpai @RetrospectivePC Forgot about Tokiden, but that game had other problems as well. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Chr0nite @MoogleSenpai @Margolis64 @RetrospectivePC Indeed. Weapon durability was cut in half. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 @MoogleSenpai @RetrospectivePC TK ports had 60 FPS. It was using PS3 textures that make them questionable. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @RetrospectivePC @MoogleSenpai Well, there is that too. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai Ehh, still getting it. Still said to be the definitive version graphically speaking. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 @MoogleSenpai I would not be surprised if that stays 30 for the same reason. Only the GC ver. had 60FPS in battle. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai @Margolis64 30FPS is lamentable, but since it was tied to the game logic, there's nothing that could've been done anyway. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @DSP_txt Nope, though I don't use Beta versions, so that might be why you get restarts often. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MainEventTV_AKA Pretty much. I kinda wish they'd follow Guilty Gear's example. At least that's proof you can preserve a style in a 3D jump. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MainEventTV_AKA If they were going  the SFIV route, they should've went with a better art style than that. Doesn't look like a PS4 game. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I understand why SNK went with 3D graphics this time, but the entire presentation looks so uninspired. Graphics look like an OG XBox game. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @MainEventTV_AKA Still can't get over it. This is why I watch these streams. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 ....ReBirth;2 get. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TylerHa68443921 Seriously? He's just crying for attention. We've heard the previous "debates". <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @RockawayCarter @MorgueZombie Ehh. Cuban Geese and Chief Gief fell by my hand. Only a matter of time before Shaobips is added to the list. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @RockawayCarter http://t.co/Gh6gkx96BH <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai You got my sympathy. I know what it's like to deal with horrible relatives that are no longer a part of my life. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> So I figured out why Raiden IV didn't save my progress earlier. It doesn't Auto Save unless I switch ships or when I adjust a setting. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> OK, scratch GRID. Doesn't appear to run the way I hoped it would. At least I'm not super panicky about those 3 bucks right now. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> After Deus Ex and Raiden IV, the third was GRID for 3 bucks CDN. Why not? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Just realized I bought 3 games on Steam today. All of them were on sale. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> So somehow Raiden IV forgot I had a high score and went through 3 stages before. It's not doing it now though. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai @Margolis64 Oh, now it works after a page reload. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 I meant I'm seeing no offers. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 Not working for me. Must be a US only thing. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Maybe they might actually patch this. Seems like a really odd thing to leave in, because they REALLY got everything else right. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Raiden IV Overkill on Steam appears to be a solid port. Only flaw is that they didn't fix the odd looping/fading BGM from the PSN release. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Picked up Deus Ex since I had just enough Steam$ to do so. Still need to install and play HR once I have a rig that can run that though. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 @DSP_txt Heard The Fall was just a shitty port of an Android game. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @BadassArtist100 Chris Chan "Tribing" Brianna Wu <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MainEventTV_AKA WTF? Looks like Brianna Wu wants some more: http://t.co/KQKYhsFxLa <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @XYZRebellion21 Yup. Here's the link, the announcement is on the last paragraph: http://t.co/gZBYUtcZfA <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 I tried. Somehow, it said both my email and username were used up. Gave up after that. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 That's really lucky. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @XYZRebellion21 I figured you should know this, but Inti has announced they're going to patch in the Japanese voice mode in Gunvolt. No ETA <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kamatsubu Apparently, even Transdered folks aren't happy with what Brianna Wu just did. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kamatsubu It's Brianna Wu. Why would you even need to ask? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 His Steam account? How the fuck does that happen? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Brianna Wu's Arch-nemesis, GethN7, strikes again: https://t.co/10arg4jtAk <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ...something happens, they're quick about fixing or addressing it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Inti Creates seemed determined to make their first PC endeavors work if Azure Striker Gunvolt is an indication. Almost every time ... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MainEventTV_AKA Dammit, I can't wait :) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> So it turns out Azure Striker Gunvolt on 3DS WILL be getting the Japanese Voice mode. No date yet: http://t.co/gZBYUsVnR0 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MainEventTV_AKA She based her argument on an out-of-context, roughly translated quote from an old interview with a graphic artist. Nonsense <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MainEventTV_AKA You know she's still gonna chimp hard even if Nintendo steps in. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It's good to finally be back home. Just finished unpacking and got laundry sorted. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> And I just found out Chris Chan is taking belly dancing lessons. Guess that one video he did years back wasn't enough for him. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Welp, it was a fun week in B.C.. Now it's time to fly home. Just hope there aren't any flight shenanigans this time. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I have to remind myself to refresh twitter before making tweets after being away for a few hours next time. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @OperativeRen @MainEventTV_AKA @RockawayCarter Why couldn't they make this the default? Looks pretty badass, IMO. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It's safe to pick up Azure Striker Gunvolt now if you haven't done yet. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The keyboard layout has apparently been adjusted to make more sense, though remapping keyboard controls will come in another update. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> To be specific, anyone playing Gunvolt on a controller can now use skills via right stick. Before, you had to either use F1-4 or click them. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> At least Inti Creates are on top of Gunvolt's PC port. They've fixed the controls and will add key rebindings later. http://t.co/EXatQl2vdc <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 I will say TK does have bad DLC practices though. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 Other companies have had shitty PC ports though, and TK's ports haven't been super offensive (baring DoA5 and Toukiden Kiwami). <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> In a couple of hours, I finally make my first trip to the States by driving into Bellingham, WA. No, I'm not going farther into Seattle. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @drgnkiller Yeah, I call BS. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Again, makes sense. No resolution options (Just changes window size via multiplier) and isn't 1080P. Considering it was made in 2006, eh. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Game itself does have options to change size of the display, but they change based on Window/Fullscreen. Only the latter has Sideways mode. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> So Windowed mode just has the game, while Fullscreen has black boarders. Makes sense. External config just has this and rebinding keys <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> For $2.75 CDN, I can't complain anyway. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Raiden III works fine on Windows 10. It's actually a translation of a PC port made years ago, but it plays exactly as it should. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Now that Raiden 2 and DX have finally been working on emulators since 2014, maybe those two will finally get PC releases someday. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Hell, I only found out Raiden IV: Overkill was coming to PC because I JUST noticed a GameFAQs listing. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> This is coming out and you get an additional 10% discount on top of the 10% off launch sale if you own Raiden III: http://t.co/H4LrR0PlOy <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> http://t.co/JnUdRBPCKT

Got this on sale. Why? Because... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kamatsubu Harvesting or sparing Little Sisters? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Internet died for 12+ hours due to power outages nearby. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @OperativeRen They just fixed the display issue for anyone with AMD. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Singh_Long Not to mention people who use controllers shouldn't be forced to use F1-4 keys or a mouse to use skills on a touchscreen. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Good news. Gunvolt has been patched and is now working just fine. Just wish I could rebind keys, because the keyboard layout is atrocious. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @XYZRebellion21 @OperativeRen There's an unfortunate issue where anyone with an AMD GPU can't see shit at all. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 @DSP_txt @Triggrnc Still don't know what the big deal is. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> At least they're aware of it. Just hope they also deal with controls so I don't have to use a mouse or F keys. https://t.co/HJp5Hn5k9t <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @OperativeRen Just did a test. One option was a single screen, but I have no idea how it changes the game. Dunno why they didn't mention it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @OperativeRen Did you press F5 ? Heard it does something. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 I'll wait and see. If no news happens in a week, I'll refund it then. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> There's a likely possibility the Gunvolt display issues might be an AMD thing. Dunno for sure. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @OperativeRen @DjChiszle DSP threatens someone with a dox. Black DSP straight up doxxes somone without warning. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @OperativeRen Lucky. So far, no word on why many of us have display issues. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @OperativeRen It's actually working for you? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Honestly, it seems like the missing graphics are the result of an incorrect layer order, but that's just a guess. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Also, just one minor thing, but the Japanese Voice mode with the cut stuff is a separate language option...at the very bottom.   ??? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> *Decides to look up Azure Striker Gunvolt's keyboard controls*.........WHO THE FUCK DESIGNED THIS?! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> And it appears I'm not the only one affect by the missing graphics. I know this is Inti Creates' first PC foray, but still... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 It's in my library, but the game itself not out yet till another month. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Can't get Azure Strike Gunvolt to display properly not matter what I do. Not a good sign. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Uhh, Gunvolt? Why do I see only text? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Gunvolt Get! : http://t.co/mDq8Js3tt1 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 That looks fun. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 Not sure what it is. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 ??? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Wait....Rocket League on Steam can run on a potato PC? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Had I know it was going to rain for the entire trip, I wouldn't have brought my workout clothes. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai @Margolis64 @Triggrnc @DSP_txt That was cold, dude. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Well that was fun. Somehow, the party only lasted an hour longer than both the trips to and from it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Now I have to endure a two hour drive to a party, then back to the house. I never ends lol. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Finally made it and just got settled in. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Thankfully, the connecting flight was also delayed since it's on the same plane. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Stuck in the airport due to flight delay. Can't board till an hour later. Damn it! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Going offline for the flight. Be back in a couple of hours or so. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> So classic DooM games, Elder Scrolls upto Morrowind, and classic Fallout games are on GoG. About time for those who don't have them yet. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Happy Birthday @TIHYDP http://t.co/Lcx5G4mrGs <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @OrangeLight7895 It's pretty much a 1080P version of MM1-6. Only get it if you don't own a legit copy of those games and you can't get MMAC. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Looks like running in Windows 8 compatibility solves the Mega Man Legacy Collection black screen bug for me at least (on Windows 10) for now <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kamatsubu @OperativeRen Guess DSP poking fun at himself and his daughter through pedophilia jokes shouldn't be surprising. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @OrangeLight7895 @OperativeRen Is it roughly the same length for a playthrough? Any replayability? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Looks like I have enough to get some Steam$ for Gunvolt. Hope it's as good as everyone says it is once it comes. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Dunno why people say Mega Man Legacy Collection is horrible just because it deliberately reproduces the slowdowns as advertised. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 Just wish getting the display to show anything wasn't like a slot machine. Had to restart 7 times just to do that last check. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 I'll Say this, my laptop had no issues running this, and it's a pretty basic one, so this collection is optimized. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 Otherwise, just wait for a drop. Depends if you think the extras are worth it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 Other than the display bugs and no resolution adjust, I'd say get if you don't have a legit copy and want one. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 Challenge mode is like NES Remix. First challenge is random segments of MM1 connected by portals. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 and turn on a Monitor filer (Just scanlines) or TV filter (acts like a NES on a CRT) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 For Each game, you can adjust much the game takes up the screen (Original, Wide, Full), turn on a border.. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 I think there's filters too. Lemme check <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> There's a separate button map for MM1 Pausing. Makes sense. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 Only video settings are Vsync, and Windowed, Fullscren, and WindowedFull. No resolution adjustments. I'm stuck with max rez <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 The actual games don't have display issues. Just the menus for some reason. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 Feels responsive. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 Menus/splashes can sometimes have display issues/blackscreens. Restart to fix them. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 So far..... I can't downscale the game. Looks like an accurate upscaled port. There is a single Save and Load for each game. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Mega Man Legacy Collection is only 375MB. Makes sense. Time to take the plunge. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kamatsubu Gotta love dat waiting game, though. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @OrangeLight7895 Oh......don't mind me then. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @OrangeLight7895 Didn't those discs share quite a bit of data? Would've gone with around 1.4GB <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @OrangeLight7895 More like NTR: The Game, IMO. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Trying to pack for a 6 day trip involving a wedding with just a suitcase shared with two other people and a carry-on can be a bit annoying. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> I kinda hope 004 pulls a Gremlin and becomes a surprise final boss just to troll Banno. I actually think it would appropriate in a sense. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> *Reads info on latest Kamen Rider Drive ep*.....Guess that explains why 004 was silent in earlier eps. That was legit unexpected. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @OperativeRen @RockawayCarter @MainEventTV_AKA @ZaiberuYumiko @Angelheartnight @DevHunterJames Prepare for IQ dropping. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 I think he's referring to Kiwi Farms. They discuss lolcows like DSP. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> The fuck happened to twitter? Somehow, a response got super delayed. Must be the storm outside my house. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Just found out LowTierGod lost his job earlier. Didn't see that coming. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @OperativeRen @Margolis64 Was just announce today, so far I haven't seen one yet. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> This fucking 4+ hour "debate" is fucking up my brain. So much dodging and backpeddling. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @OperativeRen @Margolis64 I should say, if you buy Gunvolt on the first month it's out, you get Might Gunvolt for free. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @OperativeRen @Margolis64 On the 28th. Comes with Mighty Gunvolt just on the first month for free. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 At least I have enough right to pick up Gunvolt first. Have to be out of province for a week starting on Tuesday. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 If I manage to add more Steam$ soon, I'll grab this and Azure Striker Gunvolt. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TIHYDP Do what you think works best. That's what matters. <Text_End>

A) It takes way too long to deal with plot elements.
B) So much fucking re purposing of suits. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 Phil finally made a counter claim. Other than that, not much else really. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Even if this strike is undone:
A) Phil nuked a crapload of videos when he didn't need to
B) He has to think twice before accepting fan stuff <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @ProJackieChin: To all of you waiting for an update, Phil has counter claimed, and said that I can't change my mind if I want him to use… <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 Better hope shortly after doesn't mean 14+ days later. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 Yeah, you're better off running it on PPSSPP. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 Disappointing. I know the FPS is locked at 30, but is that at least stable? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 What graphics options does the game have? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 Just curious to see a side-by-side comparison between this and the PSP version running on PPSSPP on max settings. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 I'd be more concerned with overall stability, considering how XIII and 2 turned out. Most likely why there's no LR news. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 Depends if the porting time is unable to increase FPS without breaking the engine. IIRC that happened with Dark Souls, <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> My laptop still doesn't show major signs of activity either, so I don't really know what's up. Hopefully it gets sorted out. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Singh_Long showing otherwise. Maybe it's either a Windows 10 thing, or a Steam thing. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 1. The game is also on GoG. 2. Continuum Shift Extend is on Steam. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Remember that Crash 2 runner from SGDQ2015? https://t.co/Jzuo6YIWfi <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Each pack is a measly $1.09 in Canadian. So that's roughly $6.54 if you, for whatever reason, want everything. Can't complain either way. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Just one group is currently missing, and that just changes weapon colour. Aside from one pack, the offerings are just power ups and costumes <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> So Fairy Fencer F's paid DLC is only sold as packs in Steam compared to PSN AND are cheaper compared to an individual item. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Twitch changed its player as well. Even made the same changes Youtube did from what it looks like. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Watch how people like KG take back what they've said and refollow Rambo. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> *Hears about DSP's response to John's vid via IRC* I knew it. That's his go to response whenever something like this happens. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @EddyB43Cynic My only concern was that by default, updates can be downloaded/sent via P2P. Thankfully, you can disable that too. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @EddyB43Cynic Normal/Security updates are still forced, but Insiders get those way before normal users. If it breaks, we're safe. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> HE'S STILL ON WORLD 2?! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @OrangeLight7895 That same guy was trying to start shit on Lester's podcast. I wouldn't worry about him. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @drgnkiller: He thinks this game is harder than Crash 1. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @drgnkiller That's what he gets for trying to 100% the game on his first playthrough. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @OperativeRen It's okay. So far, nothing has broken. Start Menu works. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai @DoctorOfFizz @InvisibleCrane @loophole572 @DSP_txt Need to get around to getting some of these caps for the kiwifar.ms thread <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DoctorOfFizz @InvisibleCrane @MoogleSenpai @loophole572 @DSP_txt When was the last time he bought something conducive? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ZeroMH Probably will just drop the gems. Game is piss easy if you just stick with the crystals. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ZeroMH Welp, they got what they wanted, and now they have to deal with it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> No fuck this, I'm not gonna watch DSP play Crash 2 anymore. Who the fuck asked for 100%? That involves a lot of backtracking and FAQ reading <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kamatsubu Thus it leads to the comparison of abusive relationships. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> At least I know Oblivion and Ultra Street Fighter IV works fine. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> So Windows 10 thought it would be helpful to turn on Touchpad enhancements I explicitly turned off before. Why? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 That happened since Windows 8. Dunno why people are realizing this just now. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Why are standard Windows in Windows 10 just straight up white? Where are the colours? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm surprised I didn't have to get an ISO to install Windows 10. It's just using preloaded files from what I can tell. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Have to remind myself to turn this off once I finish upgrading. Thanks, Microsoft: https://t.co/EKzFE3Xslt <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> And now to take the plunge. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Are you fucking joking, Mircosoft? #Windows10 https://t.co/EKzFE3Xslt <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> He went with Stock Shots? Makes sense for a speedrun I guess. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> And he starts with Magma Dragoon. This will be fun. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> It's nice to see an X run in X4 for a change. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Oh snap! Looking forward to X4 <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> WTF Blizzard Buffalo?! <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 @MoogleSenpai It's the same one. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Oh crap, it's the lousy version of X3 with the sitcom music. #SGDQ2015 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 @OrangeLight7895 @MoogleSenpai BURN! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai @OrangeLight7895 Definitely an underrated entry. Wish it came out on Steam. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kamatsubu incredible laziness with costumes, since after ep19, every Roidmude except Freeze is just a slightly modified costume from before <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kamatsubu To me, Drive took WAY too long to deal with important stuff like Chase and the Dad stuff. Not to mention the ... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It's not yet complete, but here's a list of compatible games on Windows 10: http://t.co/kAJpRwt5W9 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @SBGPasc @Margolis64 This. I tried out Type-0 on PPSSPP. Was FAR from impressed. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I like how everyone seems to forget Windows 10 users aren't going to immediately get updates. Microsoft Insiders do. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Don't think I'll do the Thieves Guild and Dark Brotherhood quests. Unlike the 360 version, Oblivion doesn't have achievements on Steam <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Feels good having to get the Main Quest of Oblivion right way, though I might take a break from it before moving onto the rest of the game <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kamatsubu I don't think I'll be following Ghost. Other than that "bike", I'm not sold on it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kamatsubu Just saw a mag scan for KR Drive that shows something coming up...dear god, it had something so lazy, it's hilarious. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @Yuriofwind: "Google+ and YouTube are finally splitting up" http://t.co/1tgB8i7Z6s <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Welp. https://t.co/U7DyPlvGTd <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 Here's more proof Forbes and tinfoil hats are full of shit regarding Windows 10 and drivers: https://t.co/bQkZwgLxZZ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> How nobody caught on to gamerpro's commentary before the Crash 2 run is beyond me: https://t.co/7Vl7MAsb9E <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> NVM, found it on search. It just didn't show up on their channel. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> And it seems the vid for the SADX run was privated as well. I guess someone is been Benoit'ed from GDQ. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I might have to do a quick rewatch of that SADX run. I don't remember if GP's commentary was a sign of things to come. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 NP. Here's the screenshot I mentioned as well, just in case: http://t.co/huBjJkQTZd <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 I even saw a screenshot showing driver updates on Windows 10 are still optional. Just have to change settings. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 I wouldn't trust Forbes. Supposedly, they've been making quite a few misinformed articles about Windows 10 for a while. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @OperativeRen I just assumed he couldn't be downed before you're forced out. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @OperativeRen Carc skipped it, though it looked like it was a different angle of Nemesis getting up. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @OperativeRen You know how you can attack Nemesis when he pops up even though Mikhail takes over. You can down him for a minor extra scene. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @OperativeRen Did you just catch that moment at the streetcar? Never knew that was possible. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Yeah, this PC version has Nemesis' sounds play at a higher speed. Guess someone fucked up the encoding on those sound files. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 @drgnkiller Someone should show DSP that vid with Angry Joe's setup. That's proof enough. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Is it just me, or does Nemesis sound kinda off sometimes in this PC version? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 @drgnkiller His lemon could easily stream it at a high resolution with good settings. Dunno what his excuse is. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Now I'm wondering if Capcom will ever release RE2 and 3 on Steam. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @OperativeRen No denying that, but I think they're going for something more entertaining. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @OperativeRen Speedruns can have different stipulations. It's not new. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I don't remember the non-speedrunning aspects of GDQ being so stale. What happened to crowd noise and costumes? #SGDQ2015 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai @loophole572 According to the official twitter account, there's going to be some "discussions" due to the complaints. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> At least these runners are more vanilla. #SGDQ2015 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @SBGPasc No <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @frozentreasure: @VoidBurger @oatmealraisinSA Donations practically stopped for the run, he got less than $2K in that whole time. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ZeroMH Wouldn't be the first time. One drunk runner and an awkward commentator who cheated on an unrelated run have been soft banned before <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 This guy clearly did not give a fuck that this is for charity, not fame. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> And his game fucked up because why not. If this was his first GDQ, it'll probably be his last. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> This Crash 2 runner is so annoying on commentary, and he keeps making so boneheaded mistakes in his run. #SGDQ2015 <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> I only played through the game once. Even I saw that last character shuffle coming, and I'm REALLY bad at keeping track of stuff in games <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> We all thought it would've been the Tyrant, but all it took for DSP to rage at CV was, of all things, an easily telegraphed character change <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> OMG, DSP has no weapons to fight the penultimate boss fight in CV. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DSP_txt Trying to finish CV <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I don't remember the Castle Kvatch quest being this draining on health on the 360 version. Guess I lowered the difficulty back then. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai @OrangeLight7895 You know this news is probably going to piss of a certain Glaswegian manchild. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Chris Chan got another continuance (Oct. 15 btw), but supposedly, he let out a large fart in the courtroom. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> If I had to guess, my laptop was just being fussy loading the death animation at the time. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> That's weird. The game pulled a 1 FPS a bit once I killed the second of the first two bandits I fight outside the sewers in Oblivion. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Just have to fiddle with Graphic settings so my laptop won't sound like a turbine. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Thankfully, Oblivion ran OK despite a minor incident where it wouldn't load due to mod load order conflicts (Thank you Wrye Bash) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Upon closer inspection, each day of the Quakcon sale will have higher discounts for different franchises. Today is Elder Scrolls. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 @EddyB43Cynic Just noticed Fallout 3 GOTY's discount on Steam is only 33% compared to NV:UE's 48%. Dafuq? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @EddyB43Cynic @Margolis64 You're better off getting a used physical copy of Ultimate Edition. Should be pretty cheap. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 @EddyB43Cynic Picked up Oblivion GoTY Deluxe for $13 bucks. Can't argue with that. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 I think almost all of Bethesda's stuff is on sale because of Quakecon. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> And I had enough for Skyrim: Legendary Edition as well. Patience DOES pay off. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> FINALLY! Fucking hell yeah! Time for Oblivion! https://t.co/QAfDTi9cLB <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Looks like Tembo is back on Steam and it sounds like it's working this time. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 Hopefully 2K and Yukes get it right this year. The roster number is said to be huge already. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 Not to mention the next release is 3-4 months away. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I just realized Windows 10 is going to be released in a week. I'm going to take the plunge and see if anything goes wrong with the upgrade. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DSP_txt He still hasn't caught on to what will happen once he gets there? <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Apparently, Aspyr is trying to get that KotOR II update available on GoG as well. Hopefully, it works out, or it wouldn't be fair otherwise. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @EddyB43Cynic He thinks he's just a boss fight away from the halfway point. He's not even close. More like a quarter through IIRC. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Tembo demo seemed alright. Too bad the full game sounds like it had a botched launch. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Goddamnit. Just found out about GMG's current sale on Oblivion Deluxe and I don't have enough cash for a prepaid credit card. fuuuuck. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @OperativeRen Also, built in mounting isn't active on default. You have to set Windows Explorer as the default program for ISO's first. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @OperativeRen Built in mounting for 8.1 is a bit limited since it won't always work. That will need third party stuff to work in full. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Note: This is NOT how we normally deal with traffic tickets in Winnipeg. http://t.co/8jjDt4UPMC <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @OperativeRen "No more mounting ISO's or DVD burning through third-party mechanisms" uhh haven't had that issue, unless I'm reading it wrong <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @OperativeRen Nice, saved <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DSVoight @loophole572 From what I hear, the patches just adds stuff and only bug fixes for minor stuff because there's no major bugs. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I never knew Chris Chan did this. As someone who's parents are from India, I wish I hadn't found it: https://t.co/JG5eqwxSPL <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> IDK if this is true, but Phil might already know about the uber knife of Code Veronica. Dammit <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Oh god, Code Veronica is 1st stream today? welp <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Why does Castle in the Darkness have the default sound settings at 0? Makes no sense. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I can't remember how I got the Steam one though. Forgot I had the Origin on. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I just realized I somehow have 3 copies of Dragon Age: Origins. 1 on Origin, 1 on Steam, and the Ultimate Edition for 360. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai Pretty sure they said she's Gamerbee's fiance. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> My entire collection of Xbox and Xbox 360 games:

Read: http://t.co/yyfQNeNlYm <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 Do they do Fall and Winter sales? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Dammit, when's the next Steam sale? I really want to pick up Oblivion and Skyrim badly. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 @OperativeRen I don't think being a rape apologist is being salty. Shitting on Jared before any real facts come out does. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Person__X That might take a while. I just started the game. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Fuck you Radscorpion. I just wanted to get some clean water for my fellow Vault Dwellers. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @drgnkiller Heard the mini fridge sold out already. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @CyberIceBlood @TIHYDP @TylerHa68443921 Tasty... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DoctorOfFizz Here's one where he's a bit more...violent: https://t.co/UcA4HSJbyv <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @IWasAYoungBoy @DoctorOfFizz Here you go. You might not like how it ends though: https://t.co/qeBJrfP5IH <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> How ironic. A local bomber has trouble getting legal help because he bombed a lawyer. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DoctorOfFizz I see you've discovered the insanity that is mariotehplumber. To think, this guy almost came on the SoKast at one point. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Singh_Long At least the Genesis Core is actually being used by someone else for a change. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Looks like the second Gaim Gaiden is shaping to be much better than the first in regards to suit design and lockseeds. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Weather wise, this is not going to be a good weekend. Heat and high humidity + potential for storms. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Good screencap of the new SFV character: http://t.co/01AaBb3bEl <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Kaiserdude @loophole572 He's got a 4.0 GHz i7. I doubt he'll have problems streaming PCSX2. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Kaiserdude @loophole572 He can do it. His CPU is overkill. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @OperativeRen @DragSlayerVlogs Freeze frames show facial tattoos and dreads, so nope. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @SevenInContext @shadowraptor7 Can you handle this? https://t.co/UcA4HSJbyv <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I just love how some people can't handle Ken's redesign, especially his hair. It's like people forgot about Street Fighter Alpha. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @SevenInContext Yeah, this kid is a big fan of mariotehplumber. He loves saying friggin fricks for some reason. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @JoshRyuk Point taken <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @JoshRyuk You missed one thing the game introduced that makes it a bit easier...retries. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Singh_Long That involved also losing every fight. Some of the alternate paths also had really bad flags. Now I remember why I traded it in. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Singh_Long Actually, it wasn't just the boss. Unlocking him was fucking annoying because you had to 100% every character's story. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I remember playing this on the 360. Hated the boss. Play it to find out why: http://t.co/DQIxc5tJ1g <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Seriously, thanks to some horrible jackass, my city is freaking out over odd packages. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @OperativeRen I guess a certain HeWhoShallNotBeNamed is still a bit salty if he's so persistent on doing this shit. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> What? http://t.co/kPRaXPjVTX <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DSP_txt I didn't know xvideos accepted snuff films. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> NVM, found the stuff I wanted. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> And I just realized I haven't done anything to the Steam version of Fallout. Any unofficial patches/bugfixes I should be aware of? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Welp, I'm gonna try to start my first Fallout 1 run. I just hope I don't keep dieing to the first rat like the other time I tried this game. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Because he definitely needs a fallback for when people call him out on his BS. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I hope I'm not the only who notices how DSP "admits" to "misspeaking" about certain stuff more often than usual. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Apparently, the specs of AMD's Fury R9 line were leaked: http://t.co/6UJgA6sDjX <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @OrangeLight7895 Is it based on the life of @MoogleSenpai ? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> So is The Slaughtering Grounds the new Bad Rats or something? I see people getting it as a gift a lot. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @OperativeRen I agree. It would've taken way too long if you used his endure. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @OperativeRen Which TIHYDP of RE3 are you watching? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I only found out when I was trying to look up why those attacks at the start happened, since the explanation is tied to the optional stuff. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Odd how a large chunk of the main Tribunal quest could be skipped without you realizing it at all. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Finally finished both Bloodmoon and Tribunal. Former was much better, though the latter had better ties to the main plot. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Finally got the main quest in Morrowind done. Fuck whoever thought levitation should be mandatory. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @OperativeRen @kamatsubu He's gonna hate the part with the poison moths if he manages to get to it, since I think those will always respawn. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 @MoogleSenpai Only reason the smoke cleared up where I live was because it finally rained and the wind shifted. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @SevenInContext: Streaming now ^.^ Join us, having alot of fun &lt;3 http://t.co/OWLAu4BAcl <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai @Margolis64 I honestly don't know how this fire was caused though. Just that I had to keep my windows closed. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 @MoogleSenpai Had to deal with that same problem here in Manitoba. Those forest fires are no joke. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> So I hear DSP is "interested" in doing Code Veronica. Watch as he struggles through the game without knowing about how broken the knife is. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Person__X @Margolis64 @OperativeRen @chaffXgrenade I miss my copy of THUG 2... <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @Tommy44Vercetti @loophole572 The upcoming 950Ti is said to be around $150 as an entry level. But otherwise, it's your call. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Tommy44Vercetti @loophole572 The only thing I question is the GPU. Looks like it has a GTX 750. Swap it for anything in the 900 series <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Somehow, I completely overlooked this one detail on DSP's Crash Bandicoot playthrough: http://t.co/rKPpyEBlm1 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I do like how Morrowind locks you out on joining and/or continuing factions depending on how you approach other factions. Encourages replays <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Singh_Long Because I picked House Redoran. Unless I don't HAVE to be in House Hlaalu to kill them. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Singh_Long Supposedly I don't have to complete the Main quest to prevent this, but it involves hunting down 4 dudes, 1 I probably can't get <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> An IRL buddy told how after a certain main quest in Morrowind will trigger attacks while trying to rest in certain areas. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @IWasAYoungBoy It's fucking Chris Chan, I don't think he's still grasped a few things. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Why someone use fireworks for an American holiday while in Winnipeg is beyond me. Had a rough sleep because of it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @RetrospectivePC Neat. Didn't know UESP had a forum. Thanks! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> So any Morrowind experts know where I can improve my speechcraft skill? I don't want to keep using bribes. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> By then, you've lost half of your weapon's durability. At least the main quest might actually pick up. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> So even with an enchanted weapon, fighting ghosts is like having a slap fight in their favor until the game lets you hit it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> At least I can finally say I own every 360 game I've wanted to get. The only holdouts I could easily get on Steam instead. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The one time I decided to dig up my 360 so I can install my latest purchase, and a storm decides to happen as I'm doing it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I need to recall how to use enchanted weapons properly, otherwise I'm gonna turn into a DSP when I'm done. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I tried to fight a ghost in Morrowind using just a sword. They weren't kidding when they said non enchanted weapons were ineffective. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Of course I won't do an inventory check until I make an exchange at EB first...got a couple of games I want to trade in. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Well, an unexpected change of plans prevented me from doing an inventory check. Hopefully, I can do it tonight instead. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @thedarklurker: #DSPFanart Money, Power, Sympathy. http://t.co/y2uRVPRclS <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I had to resort to using an FAQ to find it because I thought I was doing something wrong. No wonder Bethesda added quest markers in Oblivion <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> So I couldn't find an item in an early main quest in Morrowind because the cave was so fucking dark I kept passing a rock path to climb. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> OMG, someone did a Kill Everything run for both Fallout 3 AND New Vegas: https://t.co/Ppt6pUtRqc
https://t.co/YsiFtHjgtW <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 Do you have to play the first to understand this game? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 I got Twitchy fingers. Thanks! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Also, I'm going to keep saying this, but fuck Kagoutis. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Despite installing a No Cliffracer mod, I still saw a couple of them. At least they didn't attack me even when they were close, but still. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> So advancing in factions in Morrowind also requires having a minimum on certain stats. If only the game gave me more money to train them. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Tommy44Vercetti @Margolis64 @steam_games Remember kids, say NO to bad optimization in PC games. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> In a couple of hours or so, I'm finally gonna do an inventory check of my XBox and 360 games, since I lost track of what I still have. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @SevenInContext If I ever get around to getting an xbone, maybe I'll get Live as well. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @SevenInContext I just realized I've hardly used Live unless it's to get DLC for my offline account. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 @loophole572 It's not misleading, I'll give it that. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> ..... http://t.co/di8Qiv2SZv <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 @chaffXgrenade Look at the positive..."DON'T CAWW ANYBODY!" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I do like how you don't have to report to one person at a time to advance guilds. I just hope there's still major subplots within factions. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I think I somehow got past the first faction choice between Fighters and Thieves. Gonna stick with Fighters regardless. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm  dealing with Fighters Guild quests in Morrowind, though I also joined the Thieves guild. Will I get kicked from the latter eventually? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @LordServbot: 1,000 retweets and I'll use this avatar for a whole day http://t.co/ty9kpm7c2G <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @Person__X Scared the fuck out of me. I don't think I looted his body though. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Person__X Yeah. I just figured out that's part of Tribunal. I just started the game and took a rest at that guy you were sent to in Balmora <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I just realized the assassination is the start of one of the expansions once I got teleported to Mournhold. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Just a quick question for anyone who's played Morrowind. When is it safe to rest without having to deal with the Dark Brotherhood? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Whoever made Vivec's layout needs to check themselves in a hospital. I Just want to get to Ebonheart <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @OperativeRen @drgnkiller Level three? That's pussy shit. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Finally, I can rest for health in Morrowind....oh fuck off, Assassin. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @SevenInContext This what you were talking about? #HorseMonster <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 @Person__X @ThatOldShoggoth I just figured he had school stuff to deal with. Probably still does. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> I'm trying hard not to watch the newly released Longplay of Fallout on http://t.co/VzOL4c4pIN because I just bought it on Steam earlier. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> And the same guys have more stuff planned: http://t.co/OKuYx8TQsq <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> So this new game Steam is a PS1 emulated port? That's different: http://t.co/c5qIEebXoC <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai Sadly, I couldn't compare the two because I couldn't switch to Disc 2. My PS1 was sort of borked when it came to hot swaps. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai Fargo was better, matey. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai Plz don't tell me your avatar change means you're gonna try to steal shit while pretending to be Australian. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Gonna have to get used to following directions in Morrowind. Looks like there are a shit ton more guilds compared to Oblivion. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 Ehh, GoG on rare occasions gives you a free copy of a game you own on Steam. Maybe I might get lucky. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 Goddammit. I just bought Morrowind at the Steam sale. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Well that was interesting...and now for something completely different. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @loophole572 @MoogleSenpai No, that distinction belongs to Kelvin. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @loophole572 @MoogleSenpai We Canadians scoff at your Farenheit system. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I just need to get used to Morrowind's combat. Is it normal for me to whiff 80% of my attacks even on a lower difficulty setting? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @TIHYDP: -@KGhaleon @MoogleSenpai You're trying extra hard lately, you do realize how foolish you look though right? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Wait...the graphics overhaul patch bundles in some of the other performance patches? Dammit... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Jeez, it takes a lot to get a graphics overhaul for Morrowind to be installed. I just hope it works <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> So Morrowind will automatically revert to fullscreen on Windows 8.1 unless you run as admin...despite this being the Steam release. WTF? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Should've seen this coming: http://t.co/1twfNnzVHw <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @OperativeRen @NagasakiSempai "It's NOT a cheat! The game designers OBVIOUSLY included this because they knew the level design was shit." <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @OperativeRen @NagasakiSempai Crash 1 had passwords as well for some reason. Phil could just skip a "broken" level if he wanted to. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Wait, so Morrowind has two unofficial patches that complement each other? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> This whole mess with Koei's PC ports feels ironic to me, since it was the Warriors Orochi PC port that got me into their Warriors franchise. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I never though of it before... http://t.co/hdkU4dxlOb <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> LMAO, sounds like Phil can't even get fear-mongering right. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Wait, what? Some people are such weenies if Doom 4 offends them that much: http://t.co/Ha4Zy4yJo2 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 I hear it sucks...not in a good way I mean. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai Funny how some "people" championing for more diversity in video games think it's OK to body shame if I'm reading this right. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The first thing that comes to mind after hearing of DSP's Swatting: https://t.co/OK0VicLEya <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @TIHYDP: RT if you are going to continue to criticise Phil despite his ridiculous guilt trip right now. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DSP_txt Did they forget what happened to Johnny Storm and how THAT worked out? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Why does Chris Chan have to make everything about wanting to have a vagina? http://t.co/d8n37H0HJD <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I find it odd how Neptunia's FMV's don't have subtitles. I assume they'll show up if I switch voice tracks, but that shouldn't be necessary <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Oh god...my eyes have been opened to Neptunia...now I see what the fuss was about, @MoogleSenpai <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> As for what the game's content is really about...I don't think I've fully realized what I've gotten myself into. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> My laptop's been surprising me. I can run Hyperdeminsion Neptunia (albeit at a low resolution). Just need to get used to using the keys. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> And now the moment of truth. Can my basic laptop run the waifus? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> So it turns out I CAN run Risky's Revenge. I've only tried it at 800 x 480, but it ran fine without issues. Maybe I should risk Neptunia now <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @OrangeLight7895 Didn't stop Solid Snake. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Now I really feel glad i didn't invest in the Arkham series after Asylum. Sounds like Barbie: Arkham Nuts is a mess in more ways than one. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Still waiting for Rocksteady to make a Batman game based on the Adam West show. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kamatsubu That one close up is more like nightmare fuel. Only the shower vid is worse. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The only one I could see certain people buying is the unlock all modes, just so they can do a fresh DMD run if SE didn't allow it like 4 did <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Dunno why DMC4SE has time saver DLC. All that stuff is easily unlocked in the game itself. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @OrangeLight7895 @SBGPasc @RetrospectivePC singh_long <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @SBGPasc @OrangeLight7895 @RetrospectivePC I'd be game too, if you'll have me of course. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @kamatsubu Only a matter of time before DSP breaks his heart as well. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @thedarkid Can't be a hunt if you wanted it deep down. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Omega_Ben @OrangeLight7895 I didn't have much of a choice at the time. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @SevenInContext @Margolis64 I see. If you have a large library, it makes sense. I usually go by rotation. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai @SevenInContext @DoctorOfFizz Once I build a rig that can run it, I can finally see what the fuss is about. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 @SevenInContext That's...kinda overkill. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kamatsubu @OperativeRen I can't believe I skipped out on Steam sales until now. I never though great games would be this cheap. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @OrangeLight7895 Just using a basic laptop not meant for gaming. One day, I'll build a lemon. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @OrangeLight7895 I did, but I can't run it yet... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Anyone up for some nightmare fuel? http://t.co/reAXfrwD7a <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I now know I can run New Vegas without raising my laptop's temp by much. Just need to determine how far I can take GFX settings from Low. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I just remembered something... http://t.co/Rr8qW65BfU <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @steam_games Dunno why this keeps happening: http://t.co/0RyvLISvS5 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Welp, just took the plunge on New Vegas Ultimate. Now I have to figure out what my final purchase will be for now. Just have $6 CDN left <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @RetrospectivePC @Margolis64 I've beaten the vanilla NV and GoTY version of 3 on the 360, so I'm going with NV on PC. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> For anyone who's played New Vegas, how are the expansions? I might buy just New Vegas, though if they're good, I'll go with Ultimate Edition <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai @mark142011 @Margolis64 @DoctorOfFizz It's not numbers that count. It's whether or not you can appreciate what you have. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mark142011 Better to wait until you're finished with 3. That's what I did. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mark142011 It's a definite improvement on 3 for sure. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mark142011 It was OK. I never played the expansions so I can't comment on those, but there are a lot more choices to make in the main story <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mark142011 360 version of NV froze on me a few of times at the same spot. Had to reset my system cache and redownload updates to pass it <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Singh_Long Depends on tomorrow's flash sale. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Since RE HD's pricing broke my heart, I'm might consider getting Fallout 1+2 instead. Already beat 3 and NV on 360 so maybe not those <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai @davemccauley I almost always cut some onion bits when I make a pepperoni pizza. Tasty. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DSP_txt @InvisibleCrane @DoctorOfFizz It doesn't even cost that much to build a basic gaming rig that's super easy to build even for a kid. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DSP_txt @DoctorOfFizz @InvisibleCrane He said JC2 was on consoles as well...don't know why he brought that up <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mark142011 Sounds like wasted potential if that's the case. For me, it's more about whether or not it runs well and has no technical issues <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mark142011 Curious about what happened with R2. Other than Co-op at launch, I haven't followed up on that port. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Uhhh.... http://t.co/zP0hn9UguS <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Oh sweet, the RE franchise is on sale, time to get RE HD......STILL JUST 25% OFF? fuuuuuuck <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 I only just tried out Freedom Planet, so it's not a huge priority. I have other games I want to look at first. I'm not in a rush <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 I'm not gonna pick it up on GoG right now anyway. Probably on the next sale. All I've got is some Steambucks right now. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 I know, but between, Steam and GoG, I tend to favor GoG. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @OrangeLight7895 Still waiting for those V and VI remakes, Square. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Oh wait, Freedom Planet's on GoG? Nvm <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Freedom Planet demo is fun, but I'm still holding out for a price drop on RE HD....why are my Steambucks taking so long to come back... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai @OrangeLight7895 Goddamn, that's awesome. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai @OrangeLight7895 That one's actually my favourite from X6. I think I tried my hand at recreating it SNES style at one point. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai @OrangeLight7895 The soundtrack in general was the best thing to come from X6. I still listen to some tracks from time to time <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai @OrangeLight7895 Fukin Gate. I'd say High Max was bad, but he's voiced by Norio Wakamoto. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai @OrangeLight7895 I think the hate for X6 is overblown. It just has iffy stage designs and a questionable mechanic. It's OK <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai @OrangeLight7895 The guy literally trashed Crash Bandicoot and Mega Man X6. What a waste. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Wasn't impressed with Arkham Asylum, so obviously I don't care for Barbie: Arkham Nuts. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I hear it's @SevenInContext's Birthday. *Insert frosting in Canada jokes here* <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Of course it could also mean how the battles will look different, but the ATB system is unchanged <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> They're still making that other port. Just play with that. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> So people are seriously complaining on how the FFVII Remake won't use the same battle system as the original. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Just got back from getting a new phone. My only complaint with the Xperia M4 Aqua right now is that it's a fucking fingerprint magnet. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @thedarkid: Same. http://t.co/QMo6trAh47 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @drgnkiller Do not want. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai Should've went with Cheetos. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Might not do this yet, but what mods should I get for Morrowind? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai @OperativeRen I swear, one of these days I'll finally buy a Nintendo console after 20 years of not doing so. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @OperativeRen @MoogleSenpai It might be just me, but Platinum is almost like what Capcom used to be. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai @OperativeRen Uhh...Transformers? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> You know what Steam needs? A check/filter so you don't have to check each game to see if your pc can run it, more so if they're not listed <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Fuck it, I can't run RE HD anyway, so Morrowind it is. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @RetrospectivePC @OperativeRen @ilikefunny505 Can definitely stand by 1. 2 was also fun, but I don't like how spells worked in that one. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @drgnkiller I could've sworn I heard they will have mods, but not right away. I might be misremembering it though. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> So Chuck Fitch started his own Kickstarter. He really is old man DSP. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Goddammit, I want Morrowind so badly, but I'm still holding out for big sale on RE HD. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @mark142011 @MoogleSenpai Lucky indeed, I'm the only member of my family who still likes video games. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @loophole572 Oh god, I never got past the first chapter of that game because if you don't make sense of the battle system, it's hard as fuck <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Where's my fucking Canadian Truck Simulator, SCS? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Anyone feel like adding me on Steam? http://t.co/jWIat2l479 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Birdie really left himself go over the years... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DSP_txt For someone claims to have changed his diet, Phil still has a strong attachment to pizza if that's his emergency food. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I have now officially joined the EmilWorldOrder. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kamatsubu Well, Star Ocean's gameplay was spun off from Tales early on... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai I know. It was mostly out of concern after what happened with Drakengard 3. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai Indeed. The game will definitely be stable with Platinum at the helm. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I still kick myself in the nuts for trading in the first Nier. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai Don't we all... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> And I just realized all the new stuff from that SFV trailer was from England. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> FFVII remake may have been heavily requested, but was it necessary? Next, people will ask for more Dirge of Cerberus. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I know I'll be crucified for this, but I honestly knew little about The Last Guardian before, and I still don't about. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm just happy we'll finally see progression in the Shenmue storyline. If only another company would do that same *looks at Capcom* <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @RetrospectivePC @MoogleSenpai But those sweet multilingual subtitles... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I need to check if I still have my copy of Shenmue 2. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> OMGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It's true.... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kamatsubu @OperativeRen @DSP_txt I remember dying easily in Rainbow Six Vegas. Not Beginner friendly. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Been playing Castlevania: Circle of the Moon. Holy fuck this game is hard. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> HAHAHAHA I fucking knew it: http://t.co/XsZDnfbeLt <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> After what happened with Xbox to 360 BC, why should I feel excited for 360 to One BC with so few details? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @FioraAeterna: Square Enix has finally given up. they will now remake the one game that cannot ever live up to its nostalgia

<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 All I wanted to do was clear up some of this: http://t.co/IvD5vD6osz <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 What sucks is that it's probably because some Jackass bought ALL of the $25 Cards, but left the $50 and $100 Cards alone. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The one time I have cash to buy a $25 Steam Card and go for it, NONE of the stores have it. Goddammit. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Welp, Trihex made it as far as he could. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> LOL, Trihex fucks up Arin. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @OrangeLight7895 You must not watch a lot of GamesDoneQuick, I see. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> WELCOME TO MARIO KART!!! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RIP Essentia. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Don't break my heart, Sinister1. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Don't save the animals <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Guess there are people not aware of that hyper beam. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Welp, guess Trihex is my only hope. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Wait, they have to beat Mother Brain and escape? Didn't expect that <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Lemme guess, escape the Station? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Goddamit, they put Arin with Essentia and Sinister1. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> So how does this Steam Monster game work? It always says game over once I get to 1000 players. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> So Chou Deadheat is just the Mashin Chaser suit with the purple bits painted red and a Type Speed helmet painted half-black with bits on it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> For 5 Mil, Bloodstained's final stretch goal is a mode that acts like Rogue Legacy, including the option to share whatever the game gives u. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @TIHYDP Have you worked out where you can stream it? <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Time will tell if the Legacy Collection turns out great. If it is, I'll buy it when I can. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Different teams are tackling each game, so we're not going to see stuff like weapons from one game being used on another. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Apparently, the Head Designer/Producer behind the MegaMan Legacy Collection feels super confident enough to talk about it on SomethingAwful. <Text_End>

https://t.co/ARjrbHWDjU http://t.co/kyHMpC3wLM <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Far too much backtracking, pathetic bosses that are optional some of the time, and odd design choices make this game hard to swallow. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Holy shit, just finished Harmony of Dissonance. Too much BS to recommend to someone new Castlevania. Otherwise, it's a test of patience. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @OperativeRen Meant to say enemies that don't respawn. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @OperativeRen I didn't like how some collectibles needed Axl to transform into enemies to respawn, since you had to restart if you fucked up <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @OperativeRen Oh god, I remember the lives system this one had. I wished Capcom would re-release this on Steam. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> So now even Giant Bomb is saying Digital Eclipse is behind Mega Man Legacy Collection. Which is it? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 @kamatsubu @DiamondDogKaz @DoctorOfFizz @BadassArtist100 @Moonman_SoK Odd how a Capcom employee's blog is the only one saying DE <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @OperativeRen @Margolis64 Is that the one where the Doppler Fortress stage theme sounds like a sitcom intro? <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 @kamatsubu @DiamondDogKaz @DoctorOfFizz @BadassArtist100 @Moonman_SoK This says Digital Eclipse: http://t.co/xqwZOtbKM4 <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 @kamatsubu @DiamondDogKaz @DoctorOfFizz @BadassArtist100 @Moonman_SoK All they did was add a challenge mode and some upscaling <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kamatsubu @Margolis64 @DiamondDogKaz @DoctorOfFizz @BadassArtist100 @Moonman_SoK That, and those two Arcade games. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @kamatsubu @EccentricFellow Supposedly, Vaas had a smaller role early on, but the devs liked his actor too much (Look up pics of him) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 @kamatsubu @DiamondDogKaz @DoctorOfFizz @BadassArtist100 @Moonman_SoK If they add some decent extras, I'll buy it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Just found the twist behind Harmony of Dissonance's Castle. Wasn't really expecting it, but now I know why the game prevents obvious routes. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @onokopress @Margolis64 Hopefully nobody was hurt. Items are replaceable. Lives are not. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Just fought a boss that almost made me use a potion...only to find out I didn't need to fight it? What is up with this game? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kamatsubu What the fuck does that mean? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Hell, I think the first boss I fought was optional since I could go around the room. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Still have no idea what the fuck I'm doing in Harmony of Dissonance. Two easy bosses so far and a room you can decorate? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm feeling bored, so I'm gonna stream some Harmony of Dissonance blind: http://t.co/lRWiRwz7xF <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai @kamatsubu @RetrospectivePC Looks like a walrus. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kamatsubu True. Neither have any real characteristics that stand out or aren't shared by the others. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kamatsubu It's not a good sign when some of the attention Star is getting should be going toward Nagi. I usually forget that guy exists. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kamatsubu Agreed. Hopefully it keeps up the pace. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I might as well get some use out of this. Ask away: http://t.co/O3HZaGtqbK <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 @MoogleSenpai Maybe wait till there's more details. If the PS3 and PS4 versions are the same, why shell out an extra $400+? <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @OperativeRen @OrangeLight7895 @loophole572 @TIHYDP Is anyone keeping score on how many accounts he's used? Dunno why he keeps trying. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It hurts how you just find out a childhood friend you lost contact with for almost a decade has been dead for a year through a stray FB post <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> So DSPWorldOrder's Youtube got terminated, while he's on his 3rd or 4th twitter account. You'd think he'd learn his lesson by now. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @kamatsubu If I remember, the store was EB Games. You know them as GameStop. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kamatsubu Fortunately, the game publisher (Koei, I think) was nice enough to send a free manual in the mail when I pointed this out. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kamatsubu and the store threw away everything packed outside the usual inner wrapping when they sell games.Usually it's the other way (2/2) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kamatsubu I once got a game that only came with a french manual inside, because the english manual was packaged outside...(1/2) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kamatsubu So do some of your games come with an extra spanish/bilingual cover and manual? I've gotten some games like that with french. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kamatsubu Dunno about the States, but French labeling is required for some products to be sold in Canada. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kamatsubu ESRB logo tells me otherwise. Besides, it wouldn't be unusual to see French labeling here in Canada. They even package covers too <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Fuck, it's annoying when your dad's clients talk so loud in a paper thin house, you can't concentrate on studying. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kamatsubu Was just making a comment on that box art. Not surprised it's a sub audio only game though. Dubbing isn't cheap. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @kamatsubu Honestly, the only reason I tried that game as a rental was due to one of the PC's being a Sikh. Awesome as that was, I got bored <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I just realized something....did DSP actually give away the rest of his P7 shirts? According to his Patreon, he still has some left. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @kamatsubu As a time saver, don't watch Gaim's summer movie. It's THE example on how you don't use movie exclusive Riders. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kamatsubu That's fine, I've been the same way lately. Right now I'm only really sticking with Drive because I might as well. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kamatsubu Of course. I'm kinda looking forward to more details on the summer movie stuff. Hopefully it turns out better than what Gaim had. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Why so casual? — Because http://t.co/5BhlK1f4a3 <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @InvisibleCrane @Margolis64 Who cares in the long run? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @InvisibleCrane @DSP_txt All that did was give her an audition. The audition results(something she has to do) are what justifies the hiring. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @Singh_Long At least with PC, all that stuff will still be there in some form. Not to mention emulators as well. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Singh_Long Why should I continue to buy console games if there's no guarantee I can still play them in a few years without launch issues? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> This news on PT is seriously making me regret buying anything for consoles. What's to stop someone from pulling patches for abandoned games? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kamatsubu @ThatOldShoggoth Never done it either :) . There's plenty of Youtube vids that show you if you're interested along with builds. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @kamatsubu I kinda miss the days where the game forces you to complete higher difficulties to see really cool stuff like endings. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kamatsubu No worries. I don't care for rankings. I just don't like how they're used for unlocks rather than higher difficulties <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kamatsubu Heaven forbid people would have an incentive for just playing a harder difficulty setting instead for challenge. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @ThatOldShoggoth So when are you going to enjoy that Big Mac? :) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @OrangeLight7895 @drgnkiller I don't see why Phil doesn't shill the soap to prisons. He can give a hands-on demonstration like that AXE. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I just love how people are salty over the Smash leak. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @CuttingRoomWiki: Our crack research team has confirmed the existence of the Ryu sound files in the  #Smash4 3DS update. 💪 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @JudgmentZenithX What r your thoughts on this? Unlike other leaks, this one is by a prominent 3DS hacker: http://t.co/DssXrp7wRJ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Interesting info for Smash, assuming it's correct: http://t.co/gT00tiGNfn <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai @loophole572 I guess he wants to be a part of the 1%. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @OrangeLight7895 PPSSPP? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai @Margolis64 Hopefully it's nothing serious. Have you tried Tums? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai Perfect excuse for another DLC pass. Spoiler alert....he's not the only example. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai Eh, it happens. Phil did forget a lot of other shit like who died though. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai I know, but I just checked the subtitles. Raiden outright called him Fujin. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai Uhhh I think that IS Fujin. Liu Kang is dead. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I KNEW IT! He made the enema joke. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @OperativeRen @TIHYDP At least you guys have something that can run the damn game &gt;:| <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @OperativeRen @JudgmentZenithX It's stupid how they said goro was preorder when he's actualy first print <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @JudgmentZenithX @OperativeRen I know. It's not the first time it's happened in a fighting game. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @OperativeRen @JudgmentZenithX you don't even have to pay for them. They're in the krypt. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DSP_txt Only makes sense if it's Bible Black... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai @DSP_txt Considering the kind of "hugbox" this is, how is any of this new? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @drgnkiller Am I weird if the thing that triggers me is that he has "Samosa" in his name? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Mortal Kombat X Stream featuring Ed Boon: http://t.co/DyBSoiYwM7 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @BeAwesomeOne @DSP_txt With a bit of dye, he can easily pass as an out-of-shape Steiner. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Wow, looks like Kiwi Farms finally noticed PandaLee: https://t.co/eXvSLCXl4y <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DSP_txt Jesus, is Grant always like he has ADHD? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @RaisinCinnamon @DSP_txt That's not how you live up to your username. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai @kamatsubu @Poonman_SoK @OperativeRen #SlanderMoon <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @OperativeRen Holy fuck, I wish people would've learned shit from the OG 360's. Consoles aren't built the same as they were years ago. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @OperativeRen As in he actually ran it on his bed? Even if he didn't, that's still rather ballsy. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @OperativeRen I can understand doing that if you don't know static electricity. We've all done it. Doesn't mean he can't prevent it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TasteTestFilms @drgnkiller Oh god....I think that's THE trophy. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai Gee....I wonder why? :) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @OrangeLight7895 Too bad that version was heavily gimped. Dunno why no one has made a translation patch for the Japanese release. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @OrangeLight7895 If you're planning on using PPSSPP, read this: http://t.co/BMj9prAvKB <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai @DSP_txt Unlike SJWs, DSP fans actually contribute to something. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @OperativeRen Definitely not an alias. I recognized the names of the other actresses listed. Either a last minute switch, or someone forgot. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @OperativeRen That's the thing...the twins actress sounds the same, the actress confirmed it herself, yet she's not listed. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @OperativeRen Definitely agree on Erron Black. From what I'm hearing, there's a lot of confusion on Kitana/Mileena though. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @OperativeRen I wish they actually listed their roles though. Who wants play the guessing game? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> So I just got to the infamous Reptile fight in MKX Mobile. Holy shit, I think I need to fuse some golds before I can progress. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @jesseworldorder Hate to ask, but what happened with KG this time? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai Heh... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @JudgmentZenithX It gets better: One of the other skins requires beating a challenge tower, even though those aren't available yet. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @JudgmentZenithX Apparently you need to login to both console and mobile versions for that unlock to trigger. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @JudgmentZenithX Weird. Connection/login error stopped for me an hour ago, though there's no sign of allies. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> So MKX Mobile has been on iTunes since last night. Fun stuff, though you start off with generic dudes. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Kaiserdude @loophole572 Seems more like a sock puppet from Phil himself based on those "praises". <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @T_P_X @Moonman_SoK At least Anita has a dental plan. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ThatOldShoggoth @Moonman_SoK @TIHYDP I've always wondered where that particular face came from. I see it in a lot of of DSP vids. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Most of MKX's story including the ending has been leaked. No forum is safe. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ThatOldShoggoth @kamatsubu More Nintendo complaints. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kamatsubu I only caught the stinger of Ninniger and all of Drive. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kamatsubu That's odd. I go to a site that uses that stream. Dunno why it didn't work for you this week. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kamatsubu Which stream did you follow? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kamatsubu Usually the RAWs take less than a day to be uploaded. Drive subs tend to follow a day after that. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @OperativeRen This is what happens when people are forced to face reality. We knew this shit for a while. They didn't want to admit it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @OperativeRen It's moreso what's happening in Story Mode and Roster from what I'm seeing. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @OperativeRen I can't help but laugh at people raging about what was leaked. SMH. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The MKX leaks have begun. Be wary. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @HungarianWOrder @ThatOldShoggoth Blame @TIHYDP. He asked for retribution, I delivered before someone else did. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Anything important that happened since last Thursday? Was doing almost nothing but studying for an exam that I just passed. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai Didn't realize you hate everyone that much. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai How is that bad news? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai I'm gonna ask this right now because I live under a rock: Who's this Zayn guy and WTF is One Direction? Is it a satanic cult? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I guess people really don't care about Bo'Rai'Cho showing up in MKX. Poor fat drunk bastard. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ThatOldShoggoth @MoogleSenpai FYI, this is what started this whole movement. http://t.co/Bv3DkwyO1D <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai For your sanity, don't go the PS4 MKX Gamefaqs board. People like to bitch about Rain and Frost not being in for some reason. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai Pretty sure it's a minority that cares about a fucking miscoloured Smoke statue. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @shutupmikeginn: http://t.co/pLEkFn2Lg7 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @OperativeRen I think this is what ultimately started the Khrome shit: http://t.co/Bv3Dkwhda5 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai A little late for this, but thanks for having me on the stream. Definitely had fun :) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kamatsubu Sounds like the standard issues of a game that emphasizes its coop features. Sometimes missions are designed around it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> #DivasExposed https://t.co/DN1Erhq5eA He certainly seems selective in how he treats his "allies". <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ThatOldShoggoth @Moonman_SOK @MoogleSenpai http://t.co/WsPzwEyMSO <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai The trick is to stay close to him. He only does his shoryuken after his short breaths. For that, you've got hover boots. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai Hell no. You'd be crazy if you didn't. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai You used the Ride Armor on MD didn't you...be honest :) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai I know that vid I sent makes it look easy. It's because it is. I hadn't touched it in 7 yrs and I suck at it. You'll be fine:) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai Which character are you using? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai It's not even worth being called drama. It's more than likely the same idiot as before using alts. Same use of "evidence:. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @JudgmentZenithX @OperativeRen Not playing nice with Raiden, that's for sure. Considering what we know so far....it's really hard to tell. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @JudgmentZenithX @OperativeRen Welp, looks like Liu Kang is Konfirmed. One of his alt was listed in a costume pack. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @JudgmentZenithX @ThatOldShoggoth Pretty sure TM already gave permission. It's Ed Boon's call if Spawn's in. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @OperativeRen @MoogleSenpai Goddamint, and I was gonna have some chips. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ThatOldShoggoth @JudgmentZenithX I just find it funny how this happens as I'm revisiting MK Unchained (fuck Konquest mode) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @JudgmentZenithX After what just happened, I don't see what could possibly hype MKX even more. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 @JudgmentZenithX All we need now is Belokk, Hornbuckle, and Sareena's two friends, and we're set. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Note to self: Never have 500mL worth of Red Bull at once.Will fuck you up for 26 hours before it finally settles down. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Kaiserdude Definitely appreciate it. Thanks! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TIHYDP I think I'll try and step out of my comfort zone this time. Got room? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @OperativeRen The steelbook was the first 360 game I got. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai I like how there's still no mention of you on the ED page. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Watch Renegade Operative play RE:Rev2 on Casual here: 
http://t.co/kcuEiXz2Ib <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @loophole572 @ThatOldShoggoth That, and backpedaling in regards to slowbeef <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @slowbeef: So, the new version lies here: https://t.co/8SgRccSslz <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Margolis64 Calm down, they know alright. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Apparently slowbeef just edited out the gameplay in "A Day In The Life Of DarkSydePhil" due to the recent drama. I don't see the difference. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ThatOldShoggoth ReMake Endure. It got cancelled due to the issues. Might happen on the weekend instead. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> #FredFuchsUpTheAudioAgain <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @TIHYDP: Let's Endure: Resident Evil HD Remake is live tonight 7PM EST.

http://t.co/VbMXm6uKp5 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TIHYDP Wait, I'm sure the votes were originally for Director's Cut. Do you have have enough time to cover both? They're both an hour each. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ThatOldShoggoth I'd say Daikatana, but that's "good" for suffering and/or hilarity. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @imadeadbrain: @Totalbiscuit Are you by any chance aware of the DMC claims being made by Machinima against "This is how you don't play" … <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @T_P_X: #DSPFanart "Wahh! They hurt my ego, help me mommy and flag their videos for me! http://t.co/7rElkOdmL7 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DSP_txt They're both KG for all we know. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @DarkstarIV: @Machinima Flagging peoples videos for something that isnt even illegal is pretty fucking scummy, guys. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @DarkstarIV: lol now @Machinima is defending darksydephil great job destroying your credibility guys (or what little of it you had) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @crow_press: @Machinima You do realize that by flagging a video protected under Fair Use is going to negatively effect you, correct? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @loophole572 More like a kid crying to his parents to do something about the other kids getting higher grades than he is. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @slowbeef Heard of the recent drama of DSP flagging some TIHYDPs, only to withdraw them so he can get Machinima to do it for him? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @OperativeRen I'd be concerned with the implications though... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Third, don't play after seven yearsof not touching the game without research.
(2/2) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> First rule of MegamanX6, don't play with a keyboard. 
Second rule, cheat out rescuing Reploids cuz fuck them.
(1/2) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @SonsOfKojima @YouTube I guess the Dying Light Endure was lost? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DSP_txt I can confirm that DSP triggered RE:Rev2's bad ending and said ending cuts off before final boss. Cue rage over replaying Ep3 again <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Oh wow. according to people who got Rev2 disc early, there are two endings, and @TheyCallMeDSP might have triggered the worst of the two. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @RenOperative Could be Panda trying to "help" Phil like she did with the Twitch account. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @JudgmentZenithX Never got Injustice, though I thought the QTE's were a normal game mechanic and not in cutscenese. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @JudgmentZenithX So MKX Story mode has QTEs. Wasn't expecting THAT. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @JudgmentZenithX @BolverkGTM Netherrealm did say the boss would be a returning character with a fun twist. Based on the comics, I say Havik <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @JudgmentZenithX @BolverkGTM It was confirmed the entire first chapter deals with that plot, with Shinnok being the last fight. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai @FornicateThou Supposedly, Smoke is one of the confirmed NPCs with Sindel, Stryker, Nightwolf, and Kabal. Others are fair game <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Does DSP not know about the Streisand Effect? He just made things worse only for himself. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @OrangeLight7895 IIRC, he was out on his honeymoon at the time of the anime. I think he became unionized afterwards, so he can't reprise it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ThatOldShoggoth @MoogleSenpai Nesquik Bunny says hi <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @MoogleSenpai: Cinnamon Toast Crunch is the best cereal ever. :D <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai Thanks :) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai I meant I need to be able to DM you hehe :) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai @ThatOldShoggoth I got a link ready. Just need to DM you. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai @ThatOldShoggoth I might have something too, though it sounds like you already got stuff lined up. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai @Margolis64 Are there any limitations as to what you can send ie. size, source? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> "Embarisse?" "Manadorily?" WTF kind of thesaurus is DSP using? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @JudgmentZenithX No worries. I've others making that mistake too. If anything, nobody getting NT's name right says a lot about the company. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @JudgmentZenithX @RenOperative @SealPhil You mean Ninja Theory, right? Team Ninja does Ninja Gaiden (where the fuck is 4?) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @RenOperative Would you be surprised if DSP called Piccolo "Big Green" at this point? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @VideoGamesPlus_: RT for a chance to win this Ultimate Zelda Package. Double your chances by visiting http://t.co/AoISXXCFXE  #Zelda htt… <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @SonsOfKojima: Announcement coming at 10:38PM EST regarding a "dramatic" upcoming project. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @SonsOfKojima That's an oddly specific time. Just sayin. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @JudgmentZenithX I'd suggest looking into it first to see if that works. (2/2) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @JudgmentZenithX It's possible to make a decent budget Gaming PC with a small form. Plenty of communities have suggestions for parts. (1/2) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @JudgmentZenithX Why not just build a PC? Seems like a better option than overspending on Alienware. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Fred Tries It: Fuching Up his audio like a ninja <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kamatsubu So now Gen is aware of Drive AND Mach, but thinks Wild and Technic are also separate. Should've seen that coming. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @SOKDictionary Define "Golden Gun" <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai Apparently that Mystic Quest remaster was a scam and Square had nothing to do with it. Thoughts? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai @KGhaleon @jabman6961 @MattsLPAdventur @RetrospectivePC Funny how he decides to start up shit again right after last night. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KGhaleon @MoogleSenpai @RetrospectivePC @jabman6961 How the hell can someone slander another with a charity? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai You'll make it to 1000 and beyond. As long as you are you, It's inevitable. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @loophole572 @drgnkiller At least you stay true to your loyalty to Studio Giblets :P <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @kamatsubu Kinda wished Gen found out about Drive though. Here's hoping Kyuu's time to shine works out as well. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DSP_txt The patreon is at over $1100.......How and why is it still rising? Trolls or not, some people are dedicated for the wrong reasons. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai @TIHYDP @RetrospectivePC @loophole572 Congrats on SoK charity reaching 35k. How does it feel knowing your backlogs are bigger? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @loophole572 When are we getting more highlights from the Sly Cooper stream? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai So he pretty much had NONE. Fuck, I wish I was surprised. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai As someone who attempted suicide (and, thankfully, botched it), shit like this pisses me off. What the hell was the "excuse"? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai @TIHYDP Are you doing each title in an order based on the game's release date or by Phil's playthrough date? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TIHYDP @MoogleSenpai Are we getting other highlights from the Sly Cooper stream? There's a huge lack of Fred Reacting to stuff. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai Are you going to snap the disc in half now? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai Where were these guys when Street Fighter IV came out? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai That and limited boosts. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai True. I just wish that the GP mode for that game wasn't closer to the original ie. end the race early because you're behind. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai I'm kinda all over the place with F-Zero. Climax had my favourite version of Mute City, while GP Legend had classic Silence. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai I kinda prefer this version of Port Town: https://t.co/n3qcPnIZh7 <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @RetrospectivePC When will that be happening? I missed the announcement on the podcast. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DSP_txt So yeah, Phil finally got a PO Box and is making plans on how to use it. This is definitely not going to bite him in the ass. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MoogleSenpai He'll destroy anything he doesn't like: https://t.co/cMgshWEcme <Text_End>
