<Text_Begin> @sarahbethmoon I AM TOO. Your dogs are adorable. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Sorry for the upsetting puppies example, Twitter feed! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Difficult male characters &amp; their unquestioned worthiness of love even if he lets the puppy die tho. That was just an off day for him, okay. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @sarahbethmoon an infuriating haha <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @SommieQueen that is so kind of you to say. thank YOU. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Like, "I CAN'T BELIEVE HE'S INTERESTED HER until she saved that puppy from the puppy serial killer now at least we know she has a heart..." <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> &amp; It's so weird that many often need VERY SPECIFIC reasons for characters to be interested in difficult girls if they have to be. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @emptysthemepark thank you so much. that means so much to me. &lt;3 <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @emptysthemepark &lt;3 hugs. thank you for saying that. I'm glad you believe it now. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @sarahbethmoon: @courtney_s And look at how common the "broken boy who still deserves love" narrative is... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @sarahbethmoon YEP. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> &amp; Maybe it's something to consider when or if you start asking yourself how any girl in pain COULD be loved/treated with patience. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> That's my long way of saying I will never perpetuate the idea a girl's pain is beyond anyone else's patience or love in my books. Period. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Romy wonders too &amp; her wondering is an indication of how worthless and broken she feels. I mean... think about that. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> But when a male character has to invest emotional work in a female character's struggle to be with her, "How could he like her?!" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Leon's at first superficial interest in Romy leads him to her &amp; after he connects, realizes she's struggling. He calls her out when needed. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @JenWilliams13 thank you :) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Like girls, if you go through awful shit, you do not have to hide your pain &amp; act lovable to be loved. You're deserving of love. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I get so many letters from girls who identify with Romy, so I feel kinda protective about her. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Leon doesn't benefit from liking Romy in that way--she's not a prop--so it's v. impossible for some to believe he even could. That is sad. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Especially when there are so many unquestioned narratives about men specifically searching for that hurt girl &amp; using her to grow. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I always feel a bit sad when people express disbelief Leon could like Romy because she's so traumatized/angry/hurt. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @YABookShelf I think they should be able to? I'm not sure! The PLRC website might have the info up now (or will when sub time is open again) <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @ghostwritingcow IT DOES. BUT I SEE YOU. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ghostwritingcow sometimes I am even told my books end so abruptly you can't even call them endings tbh <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Yes, my wonderful readers, I am aware of the hypocrisy of me complaining about an abrupt ending. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> But the ending was so abrupt and for an open world game I kinda wanted something like... 30 seconds longer for a payoff. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Barely touched all there was to do in Fallout 4, but finished the main quest. Picked the Institute ending and cried like a baby bc I am one. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> does anyone else think glenn is going to triumphantly live this season only to be definitely killed when JDM makes his appearance or <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @klvnt GASP <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @JustineLavaworm @Gwenda through my teens I binge-watched a lot of them! I think Hitchcock is what started it for me. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @klvnt awww how dare they

awwwwwww <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @klvnt don't get up until that clock is pm!!! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @klvnt well I'm all outta ideas <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @klvnt get some coffee in it! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @klvnt your beard is very rude to me <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MissDahlELama is this real life <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MissDahlELama what! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Gwenda YES! Good calls! :D &amp; The Bette Davis one is my fav. Bette Davis &amp; The Hollywood Canteen!!! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> "I'm sure I learned more from Bette Davis than anyone."
- George C. Scott <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> just seeing a male crediting his female colleague to the extent that George C. Scott does Bette Davis is wonderful. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> George C. Scott said Bette Davis was his "bloody idol." The first time I read that (as a teen) I was totally struck by it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Bette Davis told Letterman she'd write her own name for award nominations &amp; she wasn't joking. She felt she deserved them. I LOVE HER. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @emilyloringg HAHAHAHA [ded] <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ShvetaThakrar @lauratims SAME. Laura, it is so good. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @thrillerina @Yael_Itamar absolutely. it's amazing how under-credited female writers often are. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @JustineLavaworm @MissDahlELama @abbymcdonald omg consider this me introducing you all because all this awesomeness should be introduced. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @JustineLavaworm @MissDahlELama @abbymcdonald nevah apologize!!! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @JustineLavaworm @MissDahlELama @abbymcdonald yep. they don't want to admit bias. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @JustineLavaworm it really is. &amp; I'm interested if you do too. report back when the time comes, please!!! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MissDahlELama @abbymcdonald SAME!!! not today but recently enough heh

but also :( <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MissDahlELama @abbymcdonald yep. I want to say it's getting under my skin lately but it's always there so. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @abbymcdonald EXACTLY <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @wordsmaiden haha I am y/y with you!! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @JaneCaseyAuthor that too!! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @abbymcdonald YEP. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @wordsmaiden PREACH. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> oh yes, I definitely see this criticism more leveled at them, honestly. https://t.co/9CzrhhZBx5 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ex: "This male mc's view of women is lacking." "That's who he is!"
"This girl's view of other girls is bitchy." "WHY do writers do that?!" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> And that can TOTALLY be the case. But it's not a consideration I often see extended to female POV driven stories. Then it's a writer flaw. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> For example, a potentially undeveloped aspect of a story is forgiven because the (often) male POV is so limited/that's 'the character.' <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I've seen long, involved discussions re: male POV driven books where the question is, "Weak writing or true to the character's POV?" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @BrigidKemmerer haha SAME <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ek_johnston yeeeep <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It's hard to articulate, so maybe I shouldn't try on Twitter. But. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> always fascinated by the moment a certain type of reader decides a flawed female character is a flaw in the writing itself. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> just amazing <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> amazing how Maleficent is basically a movie about the realization a woman is a 3 dimensional complex human being &amp; that's why it's so good <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @theefefe @Emily_YA saflkjdsf !!! wait'll you read it. seriously. like !!!! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> "You know what the tragedy is, though. Maleficent is going to outlive Aurora."

<Text_Begin> @TristinaWright yes!! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @agnesarrows :D :D <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TristinaWright YES!!! &amp; games where story is relayed through graffiti, passing background talk, how it builds a world out <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TristinaWright YES!! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> When I was a kid/teen I used to do it with movies too, replaying scenes over &amp; over &amp; if something worked for me I really wanted to know why <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TristinaWright yes!!! so many video games have taught me so much about worldbuilding! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I used to think this was something wrong with me (!!!) but it's how my brain works &amp; learns from other storytellers. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TristinaWright right!? I can never get tired of them!! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> see how it all builds and works together etc etc etc <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> that's why I can play the same video game over &amp; over because I just want to explore every corner of the environment &amp; characters <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> whenever I find stories I love, I could reengage/revisit the content forever because I want to understand every single thing about it <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @appifanie GOOD REWARD SET-UP. what's the expansion pack???? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @appifanie it's like the sims but so much more ominous!!! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> then last night a bunch of feral ghouls killed me. like 18 at one time! and then I went to bed <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @appifanie every single vault in the fallout games is never a happy place, so you're keeping with it!!! :D <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I guess I should probably talk to my dog about what we both want in our lives in the wasteland instead of complaining about him on twitter <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> and then I go and try to kill an enemy I'm not leveled up for bc OH WELL and then I go to heal myself but no I used that stimpack on my dog <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @appifanie hahaha!!!! bless your vault. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> And then he inevitably gets injured and then I gotta give him one of my stim-packs it's like dog! why are you so reckless with your life <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Also I like the dog companion in Fallout 4 but he keeps starting fights with enemies before asking me if that's what I want to do which <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @appifanie hahaha!!! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @appifanie I am dying to play the app game but they don't make it for windows phones! sob <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Also I'd be okay with about 5,000 less crafting options and a less aggravating way of dealing with power armor tbh <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm not as into Fallout 4 as I want to be! :( Every time some settler asks me for help I'm just like [long-suffering sigh] <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> &amp;interesting trivia if a girl is not outwardly angry enough to qualify as angry for you it's because we're always telling them to be nice SO <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MissDahlELama yessss <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @aftenbrook thank you so much <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> so that is another interesting way in which we try to fit girls into a box for all of us to think about on this whatever day it is! <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @YAdultescent VERY nicely said <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> the magnitude of a girl's anger isn't solely measured in how loud she is. some girls quietly take out their breaking points on themselves. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> ATR has been interesting. I think Romy is my angriest mc but she's been called not angry enough bc it's not an explosive anger like Regina's <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> I really like The Darkness as The Big Bad though. She is unsettling. #supernatural <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The Winchesters have never met a villain who can properly tie their hands behind their backs. Like all villains, ever. #Supernatural <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TristinaWright hahaha DO IT <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @courtney_s SOUNDS LIKE A YA NOVEL TO ME <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> So Amara could bring people great joy or great horror but she has been parented all wrong so it could go either way? #Supernatural <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @theefefe I DON'T KNOW EITHER. I BLACKED OUT TBH <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Will Amara's parent issues rival that of the Winchesters? Will they connect this way? #Supernatural <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @theefefe not to bring up the time I stood near him but seriously that jerk is not aging even without tv make-up and lighting <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> I love this inconsistency with the soullessness. People who care, people who don't. BUT HOW DO THEY CARE THAT THEY DON'T CARE? #Supernatural <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @theefefe AND I'LL STILL BE WRONG probably <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Theory: Amara ate mom's soul and she's killing people now??? #supernatural <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> .@DougSolter and then try to block everything out and let that need to write push me forward in face of doubt :) #okscbwichat <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Try to remind myself I must think I've got something worth saying if I'm writing it in the first place #okscbwichat https://t.co/cJfrw3cTwk <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> .@litbeing I just wanted to know I wasn't alone in things I was going through. #okscbwichat <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> As a teen, I was less interested in stories with solutions vs stories saying, "Yes, this happens!" #okscbwichat https://t.co/Ek5kCBGFp4 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I write the books I wanted to read as a teenager. I was a lot less cynical as a kid. ;) #okscbwichat https://t.co/IWC86dsrOo <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DougSolter @helendnewton agreed! so much of writing &amp; revision is trial &amp; error, it seems like! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DougSolter @litbeing I don't have an ereader! I'm so out of the tech loop sometimes! :) #okscbwichat <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @helendnewton @DougSolter I really love hearing how things are flowing. #okscbwichat <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @litbeing I do too! &amp; That's when my process starts to suffer. I always take my sweet time remembering too! #okscbwichat <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DougSolter @litbeing !!! I need to find a way to make this happen for my novels. I bet it's weird &amp; neat to hear. #okscbwichat <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Walk away. I'm ok compartmentalizing subject matter if I remember to take breaks, play video games etc #okscbwichat https://t.co/QcJQivriNz <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> They are both too good for him. ;) #okscbwichat https://t.co/DGmsmLyEvX <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @litbeing @DougSolter haha YES. And I like to do as much as possible in each sit down. Not much voice left when I'm done #okscbwichat <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @helendnewton @litbeing @jenandapen for real! #okscbwichat <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DougSolter I think revision is like writing--each person has their own process! It may/may not involve reading out loud. :) #okscbwichat <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Not cliche! Archie comics &amp; tie-in (movies, video games, tv shows) novels! :)  #okscbwichat https://t.co/tyixbZrUUs <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> With lots of tears. ;) I edit as I go &amp; after. For me revision involves A LOT of reading out loud. #okscbwichat https://t.co/h1fEVGiWzc <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DougSolter @litbeing thank goodness for revision!! #okscbwichat <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @litbeing (thank you!!) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @litbeing very very messy in my case! :D #okscbwichat <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DougSolter ack! #okscbwichat <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> .@DougSolter it's tough, but it only takes one yes. do not sub if you have the REMOTEST beyond-usual-doubt you are not ready. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DougSolter if I have to have one, that's one I don't mind having!! :) #okscbwichat <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> .@litbeing yep! the more I write the more ambitious my novels become &amp; the more I mess 'em up before I figure them out. :) #okscbwichat <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MissDahlELama &lt;3 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> If they did, my books would stop before they started. :) #okscbwichat https://t.co/qPl5q9oWfB <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> .@litbeing each book I write presents a new set of challenges the last book prepared me to meet, but not solve. #okscbwichat <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Because every book I write is trouble in its own unique way :) #okscbwichat https://t.co/W8Cp4nE5Sd <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @jenandapen @DougSolter hi! thank you :) #okscbwichat <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Romy is interesting to me because I didn't feel it was her job to win readers over #okscbwichat https://t.co/fTb6TOYhCi <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @helendnewton @DougSolter sometimes what a reader feels abt the character reveals more about them :) #okscbwichat <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @litbeing thank you!! #okscbwichat <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> .@DougSolter feeling like you're in on a secret an unlikable character keeps from themselves can help readers connect. #okscbwichat <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> .@DougSolter sometimes on page actions can contradict words, sometimes characters let certain feelings slip etc #okscbwichat <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I kinda feel people can take or leave my unlikable characters :) BUT there are ways to open them up 1/2 #okscbwichat https://t.co/TOpuvkbiVJ <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> .@litbeing how she does it, the choices she makes bc of it, compels the readers to stay with her to the end 2/2 #okscbwichat <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> .@litbeing Romy in ALL THE RAGE doesn't always make 'nice' decisions but she is driven by pain &amp; processing that pain is 1/2 #okscbwichat <Text_End>
