<Text_Begin> @bongosaloon KANYE!!!! ;) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Celebrating Canada day just reminds me of all the borders we place amongst ourselves.  Is it wrong to want to feel more connected? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Graham__Hancock Yes I've come to that conclusion a long time ago.  Lots of great books on it even Leonard Susskind has some good work on it <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MikeLindup Its a trap us older folk fall into.  Getting set in our ways detracts from our creativity.  Explore something(where) different! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Lana_Wachowski @straczynski Was there a meaning to the license plates in #sense8 ? My wife and I definitely noticed all of them.  11:11 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @stacyherbert @bongosaloon Rest of the world should follow the Iceland method! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @bongosaloon I believe the word is flabbergasted.  Exasperated? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @bongosaloon Sacrilege! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @SethMacFarlane good observation. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @cmccosky @MiguelCabrera and a great person to boot who loved the game and the people.  Hat is off to him and will be at the game tomorrow! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Reddit really had gone from a freedom of speech platform to a paid political mouthpiece.  Its sickening.  Check out http://t.co/nW1tJtj3o4 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @_vincevaughn Nicely summarized my favorite libertarian! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @HollowKnots I can remember my first thoughts on mortality staring up a a grey sky at 3 years old. End of my childhood. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NassimHaramein  I believe you are right about the strong force but what do you think quarks etc "are" if protons are mini black holes? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @SethMacFarlane Then I'm a giant pizza with pepperoni and anchovies.  mmmmm <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @WhatTedSaid @SethMacFarlane The Science channel in Tennessee?  The Learning Channel in Louisianna?  Fox news in San Fran? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @HollowKnots @Lana_Wachowski @BryceZabel new to your work - in short you mean biology instead of religion decides gender?  I agree. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Pretty soon the only place you will be able to buy a Confederate flag will be the black market... How ironic <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Bestival @King42Mark Why is Level 42 in small print?? :)  Should be up there near the top! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @g_knapp Yes I've been observing every night and its been spectacular. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MikeLindup similarly in Canada and much more open in the US.  Its much better than it was 30 years ago kids are learning to accept now! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MikeLindup Even though Islam is a religion and not a "race". <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MikeLindup have you ever experienced it yourself there in the UK? Our perception in Canada is most UK Racism is toward Muslims <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @jonathansfrakes Reminds me of the set of the original robocop <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @straczynski wife and I didn't like first couple eps.  But we knew it was necessary setup for all the chars. Love it now entirely! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @straczynski after 5 eps I feel connected to other people for the first time in a long time. You really know how to touch people's souls. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MikeLindup I need to get me one of those new fangled narricist-sticks <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Jr administrator left his PC unlocked.  Tsk tsk.. I'm going to have to teach him a lesson with this facebook and twitter accounts :) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @bongosaloon Thanks I'll pass that along.  I've certainly heard of him but not listened. I can't get innocent abroad out of my head now! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MotherJones @bongosaloon Late 90's as a joke I went into IRC channel with a girls name.  Pop up windows and non stop solicitations. Sick! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Corrrine @bongosaloon @Independent Brights 74 Tawny ... that is packed with sugar though. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @bongosaloon Reminds me of the "Drink Beer and Get Thin Diet" I've read. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Bethblog How about the interface?  Is that going to be dumbed down as well? Or similar to the consoles (like Skyrim etc) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GeorgeTakei Just did that yesterday and the water was coooold! Global warming my butt. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Sethrogen I must ask - did you ever play an older game called Enemy Territory : Quake Wars? If not you had an impersonator online! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @bongosaloon My co-worker (drummer)confirmed - said its the first time he heard someone pull off a 7/8 that worked well like that. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @bongosaloon Could you tell me what time signature Innocent Abroad is in?  Being a novice drummer at best I'm pretty sure its 7/8? Brilliant <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @guidohatzis @King42Mark @vurnt22 In the 80's everyone worked hard to be different.  Today they work hard to be the same. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @JackFruh @bongosaloon All the members have had their own solo stuff.  I'm just starting to explore them myself. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GeorgeTakei Rose are red violets are blue.  I'm a schizophreniac and so am I <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Max_Scherzer Congrats! I knew you'd be the best pitcher in Baseball back in 2010.  You have the "right stuff" and now everyone knows it! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @OfficialFilter Never start a fight,  but always finish it. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @JackFruh @bongosaloon A little taste - https://t.co/bqWFussplK <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @OfficialFilter I love the passion man.  Let it pour out into your music.  We can all feel it and have felt it for years! Looking forward! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @KevinBTurner @bongosaloon I enjoyed a lot of songs on Retroglide.  Its really two contrasting styles.  I can enjoy and appreciate both. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GeorgeTakei Reminds us how old we are :) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @level45 @bongosaloon New one?  I didn't know Phil was still producing.  Don't hear much here in Canada but glad I plugged into Twitter :) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @bongosaloon By "influenced" I meant musically, philosophically as well as drums. That X factor in the WXYZ of L42. Innocent Abroad my fav. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @bongosaloon Just bought Watertight last week really enjoyed it. I can really see how much you influenced L42's early days. Fantastic work. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @King42Mark This has to be one of the best performances as a band I've ever seen from you guys.  Took it up a notch like you were 20 again! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @SirPatStew @sunnyozell With a little help from mother nature.. :) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @WilliamShatner You guys have managed to leave a legacy behind on film and in the hearts of fans.  What more could you ask for in a life? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @CNBCnow LMAOPAO.  It is so rare to see justice done to such an evil evil person.  I can't help but bask in this schadenfreude. <Text_End>
