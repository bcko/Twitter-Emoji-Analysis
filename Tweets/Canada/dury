<Text_Begin> @DmMurdockErrors And you've read those of course, in the ancient greek, right? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DmMurdockErrors what you said wasn't an explanation... it was a jabberflipper. You can call it what you want, it was during a debate. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DmMurdockErrors "interest in the debate" =/= "interest in whether they existed" <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DmMurdockErrors you are fluent in Roman latin and Ancient Greek, Hebrew and Aramaic... correct? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DmMurdockErrors unless you personally have returned to primary source material and researched all this yourself... of course. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DmMurdockErrors I'll repeat. "you use them to shut down debate and convince others of your side. That's clear Appeal to Authority." <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DmMurdockErrors no, it's simply that there's neither a need or interest in the debate. Same as the Buddha, Confucius or Lao Tzu <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DmMurdockErrors you use them to shut down debate and convince others of your side. That's clear Appeal to Authority. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DmMurdockErrors and there's debate on their actual existence... especially Socrates. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DmMurdockErrors I still don't concede. I accepted that I was likely in error, but I don't really think so... <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @DmMurdockErrors certainly nothing to get worked up over... <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @DmMurdockErrors some are, but ok... decades... but then Horus was a god, so centuries meant nothing <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @S_J_Johnson I never said it's not theirs... I said the system shouldn't allow for it... appropriation would only occur at the beginning. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @S_J_Johnson they built it I would imagine... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DmMurdockErrors yes, like "Acts of Paul" not being by Paul... I get that, but there's more wrong in original sources than that... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @S_J_Johnson in it's simplest archaic form, exactly. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @S_J_Johnson that own/control the means of production... the capitalist.  2/2 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @S_J_Johnson it's not a matter of "having more"... income disparity will always exist I believe. what I'm talking about are people  1/2 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DmMurdockErrors I think you are getting too caught up on the term forgery... it could be a lie, inaccurate, a deception, etc... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @S_J_Johnson pretty sure it's the same as anyone's... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @S_J_Johnson for freedom. Freedom is not achieved in an environment of inequality. It's achieved on a level playing ground. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DmMurdockErrors as I said, I'll get back to you...  ;-) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @S_J_Johnson nope. I would say that the means of production should be in the hands of the workers. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DmMurdockErrors I own none of Ehrman's works personally... but if you insist I'll see what I can do next week at the school library. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @S_J_Johnson it hardly voluntary if one controls the means of production and the wealth and the other party it's a matter of survival. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @S_J_Johnson permitting and encouraging classism is not freedom. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @S_J_Johnson wealth inequality is not freedom <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @S_J_Johnson wage slavery is not freedom. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @S_J_Johnson IMO, there's no freedom under unrestricted free-market capitalism. So... what I want and what you want are totally divergent. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DmMurdockErrors sure it does. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DmMurdockErrors I just said... I jumped in on, what I considered to be, an incorrect use of FoC... I see nothing wrong with that. Do you? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @S_J_Johnson I had thought we had common ground to work from... we don't... so why bother continuing?  :-D <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @NDPStephanie I was just wondering about your "socialism" list and it's inclusion of NDP candidates... doesn't make sense anymore. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DmMurdockErrors I responded to what I saw was an incorrect use of FoC... I never even knew what the previous discussion was about. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DmMurdockErrors not relevant to what WE were talking about, not one bit. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DmMurdockErrors 
http://t.co/WDMaVwnzBg <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DmMurdockErrors again... I never mentioned it... irrelevant. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DmMurdockErrors never once this evening did I mention the existence or non- of Jesus. Nor is it relevant to the conversation we had. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @S_J_Johnson ah. 'nuff said. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @S_J_Johnson  you're libertarian? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @S_J_Johnson it could, and I'm sure would, but it would only be in limited areas. an organized professional army would run roughshod over it <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @S_J_Johnson how will they organize? what makes them an "entire citizenry"? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @S_J_Johnson I was being more figurative... let's say the US went anarchist... Mexico will just walk in and take over, or Cuba, or Russia. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @S_J_Johnson no, it does... if everyone is not on board, someone will take the AK47 and become the "strongman"... with no real opposition. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @S_J_Johnson no prob... it's something I go over in my head all the time... it's also why I'm not a statist communist... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @S_J_Johnson what you are looking for is a universal consensus... and we have that on absolutely nothing. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @S_J_Johnson has that universally changed? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DmMurdockErrors Ehrman wasn't talking of "forgeries" but that plagiarism, redactions etc make historical documents into forgeries. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DmMurdockErrors no he does not. Ehrman "lambasts people that give validity to scripture that clearly contains forgeries, redactions, etc." <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @S_J_Johnson I disagree. Human nature is what it is... and as I said, I appreciate anarchist motives, but not its mechanics. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DmMurdockErrors the existence of jesus and who agrees with you on that is irrelevant to the conversation. not sure why you brought that up. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DmMurdockErrors no he wasn't... what makes "apocryphal" texts forgeries and biblical not? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @S_J_Johnson wealth primarily today. Passed over from aristocracy, historically. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DmMurdockErrors no it doesn't. You said "You also cannot have different standards for different texts." I explained why that was wrong. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @S_J_Johnson and as I said, that's an impossibility given human nature. Someone will always rise to to lead and others will follow. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @S_J_Johnson nope... but it needs to be examined objectively and unemotionally. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @S_J_Johnson well... a gun, tank, F16 goes a long way to backing that impression. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @S_J_Johnson and be replaced by the next system that a different  group feels oppressed by... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DmMurdockErrors on what points? he lambasts people that give validity to scripture that clearly contains forgeries, redactions, etc. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DmMurdockErrors superficial because what's the significant difference between apocryphal and non-apocryphal... <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @S_J_Johnson it's meaningless when discussing the value or non of a political system. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DmMurdockErrors 1. my comment wasn't based on your claim so it's not irrelevant; 
2.  no, it does not. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DmMurdockErrors "something like that"... any difference is superficial only. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @S_J_Johnson they become meaningless in context because someone will always feel oppressed. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @S_J_Johnson that was your opinion... I never disagreed with you. I think government is coercive, but I don't believe that can be stopped. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DmMurdockErrors 
1. never said you did. 
2. it may not, but it's followers do 
3. I don't care, if they have common sense they would <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @S_J_Johnson exactly, so ideas of "imposition" or "coercion" become meaningless. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @S_J_Johnson that, but then we become prey to "strongmen"...  2/2 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @S_J_Johnson I'm just saying, regardless of what system is in place, someone will feel "oppressed". Anarchism would negate...  1/2 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @S_J_Johnson and, as I said, ultimately what they feel is what matters... since imposition is subjective.  ;-) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @S_J_Johnson no, but again, Davis and ilk certainly feel imposed upon by current laws and policy, correct? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @S_J_Johnson not what I meant... see tweet I just sent. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @S_J_Johnson no, what I was saying that even when we try to open up (SSM), someone will take it as gov imposing on them.... <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @DmMurdockErrors in logic, I'm not sure that's right... I'll throw this to a prof or someone next week. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DmMurdockErrors why I say I won't concede is because I'm not sure if "bad things" qualifies as a negative, ie. like -A <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DmMurdockErrors that is a good example... I'm not ready to concede but I will admit that's how it looks by his definition. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DmMurdockErrors looking at it now... where exactly is this proof? <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> RT @DmMurdockErrors: @dury Wrong. Harry Potter is not a part of London. so your example is flawed. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @softheartedfool the possible incorrectness of the interpretation doesn't affect the phenomena in the slightest 2/2 @VoxVorago @Atheist_Eh <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @VoxVorago and the statistics is just an interpretation, which may be significant, but only an interpretation @softheartedfool @Atheist_Eh <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @softheartedfool the interpretation may end up being incorrect, but the phenomena remains. @VoxVorago @Atheist_Eh <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @softheartedfool not true. Science is the describing, and interpretation, of empirically evidential phenomena. @VoxVorago @Atheist_Eh <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @joffswag why would the effectiveness or not of western action affect your mental state? Apartheid fell. @Petapup1 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @joffswag yeah... 'apartheid' and it's fall had nothing to do with 'capitalism'... SA is a capitalist state now as it ever was.  @Petapup1 <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @joffswag I'm sure they did. I also know it was insignificant to the fall of apartheid. @Petapup1 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @joffswag when I said "dispersal of wealth" it implies redistribution in a socialist/communist context. RW use is irrelevant to what I said <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @joffswag I truly have no idea how that applies in anyway to what I said... I was speaking of faux leftist academics and celebrities. <Text_End>
