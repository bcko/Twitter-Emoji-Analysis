<Text_Begin> @polesky29 If you looked at their run differential in first three months, there was plenty there to indicate where they could go. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MikeCormack I think Edward's comments tell you where that message track is headed. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> If I were doing media training for Shapiro, my first question would be "Can you summon tears on demand?" I imagine he'll portray as wounded. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I think in the end, Rogers figured out how bad this was going to look, and gave as much term/$ to AA as possible. But die was cast. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @MikeCormack I doubt the people involved could even tell you what happened. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> There's a lot of happy affirmative noise in the interview process, where people hear a lot of what they want to hear. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Did those who hired Mark Shapiro fully understand his interest in the on-field product? Did he convey this? Did either side care? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TSNJR There have been two knuckleballers of any consequence in the past two decades, and the other dude has a WS ring. Also, reigning Cy. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TSNJR It's good that there is an absolute rule of thumb for that quandary. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TSNJR (I didn't like the trade at the time to be honest. But Dickey was an important part of this year's success.) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @TSNJR No, but it wasn't a bad trade. Also, Jays needed a top two starter that offseason. If it wasn't Dickey, woulda been someone. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @House4545 @bluejaysbatboy @james_in_to @coolhead2010 And they'd never won it all yet. That series was tense. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Just brace yourself for a lot of delicate, tactical smearing of Anthopoulos over the next three months. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Do you really think that Shapiro was going to give AA that much rope? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> This really is the best course for AA, though. If he gets new gig in next 12-18 months, will likely get 5-7 years to see vision through. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @LoRichTimes I think AA probably pushed hard for full oversight of player personnel. He had leverage, after being over a barrel for years. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> If you've never seen Black Mirror (especially the episode titled "The National Anthem"), well, now's a good time. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @JSilvertown Agreed. I think the Red Sox were never as bad as it seemed. They'll be in the mix next year. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> This Ryan Adams reworking of Taylor Swift's entire "1989" album is really great. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The Red Sox are mediocre, except for the fact that they've been 27-19 since July 30th and outscored their opponents by 61 runs in that span. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @jacksfootball @thunderball1973 Well, there's still a week to polish the trophy. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @scottdeveau Pompey slugged .421 for the season in AA and AAA. Revere never slugged higher than .364 above AA, and career at MLB is .345. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @EJmizzi He can give some rest to Pillar, who's had a long season and not much rest thus far. Pinch runner, occasional pinch hitter. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @scottdeveau .414 OBP at AAA in 42 games in the second half. Not a ton of power though. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I'm really happy to see Pompey back with the Jays. I still think he could be a key contributor down the stretch and into October. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @CrazzzyQball I would assume. They won't bring back Buehrle on short rest and Stro won't be ready THAT quickly. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @CrazzzyQball I believe he'd be eligible to come back in that situation. I'm not sure what corresponding move would make this happen, tho. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Important distinction: Josh Donaldson didn't say "Suck my cock!" He said: "You can suck my cock." Which is far more polite. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @DelsnyderTweets You're right. That was a little more gleefully nasty than was required. Sorry. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> That's an easy 96 Price is running up there. And almost nothing more than a few inches off the plate. Total class. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @the_Zubes I could sense a bit of GROF's soul wither on that high strike three. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @thegrumpyowl He reminds me a lot of Jimmy Key, except with an extra six inches and 10 MPH on his pitches. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Mike Sciosica should be coachin' 'em up better than that. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Nothing about which to get upset. Just a lot of churn. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @pantherblood147 If a pitcher is good, it's better to try to give him as many innings as possible. Kershaw would be a lights out closer, no? <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @pantherblood147 Gibby is good, not clairvoyant. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @pantherblood147 Loup pitched well against righties over past two seasons. This year has developed into a bad one. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @WoollardRob All things being equal, I think you want Martin getting regular playing time, but you can see that injury affecting him. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> But seriously, Jays fans: The good guys won the game. Let's stop pulling our hair out. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Please respect my wishes for privacy so that I may begin the healing process. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I've unfollowed someone. There will be no further comment at this time. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Given the way that the game played out, I figured this would have been the outcome. Underlines that bench warning system sucks. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Oh, really. Calcaterra spends five minutes fielding angry screeds from Jays fans and he's ready to tap out? *makes title belt motion* <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It's the cost of doing business. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> So you appeal the suspension, knock it down to two games and throw Sanchez for two innings in the game before it comes into effect. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> RT @bnicholsonsmith: #BlueJays now have ~60% chance of reaching the playoffs per @fangraphs &amp; @baseballpro <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> It's possible to work batters inside without throwing at them. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Oh, hi Royals blogger. Is "Josh Donaldson doesn't understand baseball" really the crux of your argument? <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @gideonturk Rick Brace knows sports very well, and is a pretty intense competitor. I think his presence augurs well for Jays. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @_DaveAnthony Yeah, some bad defensive or overly aggressive swings early in counts. Maybe just a bad jag. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Mitch_Wheels This seems like an overstatement. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @cross_ross08 He hasn't always hit though. Had one great month in his MLB career thus far. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @_DaveAnthony 9 Ks, 5 BBs in 84 PAs. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Kevin Pillar's last 28 days: .213/.268/.280. Yes, the Jays have a deep and potent lineup, but he needs to find himself at the plate. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Now let's look forward to seeing David Price dealing as a Blue Jay, and some very meaningful games against the Twins. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @Guylamoine That the Royals weren't throwing at anyone, Sanchez was the first HBP with intent, and Jim Wolf is a saint and a sage. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ian_mendes I'm thinking Buck Showalter might be a tad more circumspect about this tactic were my plan in place. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @RyanQuinlan97 Well, Volquez did make one All Star Game eight seasons ago. So there's that. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @itsryanbarclay @TSN_Marsh Home runs are awesome. You hit one, you get to pimp that. Fans love it. Celebrate good times, come on! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Here's a solution: Instead of warnings, put the manager of  team initiating in the batter's box and allow other team to throw one at him. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DanielYRubin I could almost argue that Wolf took the right approach, but he probably could have let Sanchez's HBP go. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @DanielYRubin I dislike warning system, because it gives "first-mover advantage" to the team that initiates. Wolf gave KC so much leeway. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> BTW, cheers to the KC Star's always excellent @McCulloughStar for his coverage this weekend. He deserves none of your scorn. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Volquez says they were throwing at Donaldson because he was pimping HRs, then has temerity to call him a baby. What a maroon. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> The Royals broadcasters were so deliberately oblivious during yesterday's game, it's embarrassing. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @ellopan I don't know that I've seen Gibby go nose to nose with an umpire like that. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> (Yeah, even you, Mr. The Jays Can't Manufacture Runs. You damn fool, you.) <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> That was fun, Blue Jays fans. I'm glad I could be there with you. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @AndrewStoeten @james_in_to Buzzed right after Tulo got hit. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> That was about as intense as I've seen a Jays crowd. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @LawlerBrent Or he didn't like getting thrown at. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @robert_hiltz But I like the numbers I like! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @HockeyCardsRule I guess I don't think in absolutes. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @RMurph103 Yeah, Colabello and Smoak and EE creating a logjam. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> On the plus side, DFAing a dude with an .838 OPS means things are going well for your team. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Valencia's DFA makes me angry at Aaron Loup, because I am nothing but raw emotion right now. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Aww, Valencia. 😢 <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @GrahamComfort Believe Gibby said Revere will hit 9th. Imagine he'd slot in where Carerra has. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Seeing David Price as part of that celebration was awesome. He looked bemused. <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> @donkyho Last year, Revere was -18 on defensive runs saved. Colabello is -15 in the OF the last I checked. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> I don't love Revere. Pretty good OBP with speed, no power and iffy defence. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> (Sorry, that's terrible. The sort of thing I should reserve for blogspot dot com.) <Text_End>

<Text_Begin> Woo! <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> @BuffieBlitz Had this thought today. Would prefer Buehrle, but would definitely (maybe) re-up Dickey. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Dickey's basically had one bad start in past two months. Also, he and Martin seem like they're having great rapport lately. Like just then. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> BTW: Dickey looking pretty good lately. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Colabello woulda had that one. <Text_End>
<Text_Begin> Contracts aside, would you rather have Colabello or Ryan Howard? (He asked without checking Fangraphs beforehand.) <Text_End>
